## Synchrony
Spatial synchrony in SE US brook trout populations was moderate, especially when compared to highly synchronous climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and flow. Climate is often considered to exert strong effects on temporal variation in animal and plant population size [@stenseth2002; @saether2004]. We utilized a compound spline correlogram that compared abiotic and biotic factors to create a novel comparison of synchrony. We hypothesized that patterns of spatial synchrony would be similar between climate variables and trout populations, if climate exerted a strong effect on population trajectories across space. The spline correlogram for juvenile density exhibited a similar shape to that of winter flow, with a defined dip at around 150km. Otherwise, spatial population synchrony of the native coldwater fish was modest in both magnitude and distance, and was much weaker than that of climate variables. Initial and average correlation among observed precipitation and temperature was over twice as strong as correlation among trout populations (Fig. \@ref(fig:compound-corrgram-plot)). The climate variables were also significantly autocorrelated at far greater distances than were trout populations. Patterns of synchrony were mostly dissimilar between abiotic and biotic factors, suggests that these climate variables are not exerting strong pressure on the synchrony of brook trout. The strength of spatial autocorrelation may have differed between the biotic and abiotic responses because trout populations responded to climate heterogeneously over space.

Our population model further demonstrated that populations of this coldwater species were only moderately synchronized. ICC values varied across the landscape, revealing both regional and local diversity in synchrony (Fig.\@ref(fig:YOY-ICC-map)). On average, northern populations were considerably more synchronous than southern populations, likely a result of subregional differences in population responses to climate. As the more threatened subregional population, southern Appalachian brook trout may benefit from their relative asynchrony. The most synchronous populations were located in eastern Maryland and in Great Smoky Mountain National Park, however there were no characteristics of local habitat that particularly distinguished these stream segments. Life stage differences in synchrony were also apparent. YOY fish populations were more than twice as synchronous than were adults, supporting prior indications that YOY brook trout experience higher synchrony than adults [@kanno2016]. This pattern of stronger synchrony in juvenile life stages is well-reflected in the literature, occurring in fish taxa from other salmonids [@cattaneo2003] to warm water and shoaling fish [@reyjol2008; @grenouillet2001]. 

It is important to recognize that inferences in population synchrony and heterogeneous responses depend inherently on geographic extent of investigations [@levin1992a; @wiens1989a], demonstrated similarly by our parallel analyses of regional versus sub-regional data. In brook trout, previous studies have reported stronger magnitude of spatial population synchrony than the current study, but they were much more limited in geographic extent [@kanno2016; @zorn2007b]. Estimates of the spatial scale of synchrony in freshwater populations vary widely [@myers1997; @copeland2011], however our estimates were in line with previous studies of brook trout [@kanno2016; @zorn2007b], as well as with other freshwater species [@tedesco2004]. Our macro-scale patterns emerged through analyses of multiple spatially and temporally replicated data sets (159 stream segments over 34 years) dispersed across over 100,000 km$^2$, and they provide a unique synthesis of climate vulnerability of this sensitive coldwater fish.

Our analysis revealed that climatic patterns in summer temperature and winter and spring flow explained temporal variation in early-life-stage abundance, supporting the notion that coldwater stream fish in their range edges are sensitive to extremes of temperature and flow [@santiago2017]. Climate variables affected abundance of young-of-year trout more than adult trout over time. Life-stage-specific responses to stream flows are well documented in stream salmonids [@cattaneo2003; @kovach2016; @kanno2017]. Early life stages of trout suffer high mortalities when high flows mobilize stream bed substrates, as corroborated by diminished young-of-the-year abundance in summer following wet winter and spring in this fall-spawning species. These findings support our hypothesis that stream flow would have a stronger effect on the juvenile life stage than the adult stage. We also observed that young-of-the-year abundance in southern populations decreased following a hot summer in the previous year. This pattern is less frequently documented in stream salmonids than are flow effects [@kovach2016]. A potential mechanism is high adult mortality due to elevated summer temperature, which would lead to low spawner abundance in fall. Our data show that adult abundance was moderately sensitive to temperature in the previous summer, however this was in the northern populations, rather than the south, where juvenile experienced temperature effects. While low spawner abundance can result in low recruitment, higher spawner abundance does not always result in higher recruitment in brook trout [@grossman2010; @kanno2016; @sweka2022]. Alternatively, this species delays or skips spawning in fall following hot summer [@warren2012], and this sub-lethal effect could lead to lower YOY abundance in the following year. Regardless of mechanisms, heterogeneous responses to climate variables between life stages may provide a demographic portfolio effect [@dybala2013; @schindler2010; @schindler2015], which can buffer brook trout populations from thermal and flow alterations to some extent. 

Climate effects on temporal animal abundance differed geographically at both broad and fine spatial scales. As hypothesized, elevated temperature in the previous summer explained temporal variation in young-of-year trout abundance in the southern subregion more strongly than in the northern subregion. Populations of this coldwater fish inhabiting the southern extent of their range were indeed more sensitive to elevated temperatures. While spring flows had a negative effect on juvenile abundance in the south, they trended positive for juvenile abundance in the north. With earlier hatch dates, trout in southern populations may be more able to withstand late spring flows than those in northern populations. Within these broad-scale interactions, we also observed interactions at fine scales. While regional and subregional climate effects were mostly negative, individual population responses varied. Several populations had strong negative responses, while others experienced positive responses to climate - particularly spring flow. Correlation analysis revealed that local climate responses were moderately influenced by local habitat. These correlations give further support to the notion that climate interacts with local habitat to produce complex cross-scale interactions [@soranno2014].

We found that regional climate exerts considerable influence on populations of a native coldwater fish species. While homogeneous at broad spatial scales, climate nonetheless resulted in heterogeneous local responses. We hypothesized that local variation in climate effects would provide evidence of their relative synchronizing or asynchronizing influences. When comparing the ranges of these local effects, however, we saw little difference between the climate variables. These population drivers aren't necessarily drivers of asynchrony in brook trout. In fact it seems more likely that they are drivers of synchrony, and that local interactions with them are responsible for any asynchrony between populations. While asynchrony was not correlated with any local habitat characteristic considered in the present study, could an unobserved local factor be responsible for the observed heterogeneous local responses to homogeneous regional drivers? Groundwater, for one, is an aspect of local habitat that can buffer the negative effects of temperature and flow [@cartwright2018; @brunke2003]. It can also provide superior spawning and rearing habitat for fish [@curry1995; @blanchfield1997]. Groundwater influence, however, remains difficult to measure and predict over broad spatial scales [@kalbus2006]. Likewise, stream shading riparian vegetation are a highly local habitat factor that is difficult to measure at broad scales but can buffer temperature and flooding. In fact, increasing evidence suggests that it is this highly-local habitat heterogeneity that buffers synchrony and provides climate refugia [@larios-lopez2020].

Climate refugia are of growing importance in ecological studies. They are typically identified by local abiotic characteristics [@ashcroft2010; @cartwright2018]. However, a commonly identified weakness with traditional approaches to identifying refugia is that verification is seldom carried out [@barrows2020]. By modeling populations across broad scales, we can build on this by identifying refugia using empirical biotic evidence. In measuring asynchrony, we can identify locations and populations that are potentially resilient to climate stressors.

Spatially heterogeneous and asynchronous population responses to climate have implications for the conservation of this and other threatened species at their range edges. Previous studies assumed homogeneous and synchronous population responses to climate change in salmonids [@meisner1990; @rahel1996], and up to 97% habitat loss was projected for brook trout populations in the southern Appalachian Mountain streams [@flebbe2006], which corresponds to the southern sub-region of our current study. Although climate change is undeniably a major threat to the sensitive coldwater fish, our results demonstrate the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and recognizing that some populations are more likely to persist than others in a changing climate. A key challenge lies in identifying a set of priority conservation populations in a landscape in an increasingly uncertain and non-stationary environment [@heller2009]. Our results inform this challenge. Priority conservation populations may be identified from gradients of population synchrony and heterogeneity to climate variation, so that a portfolio of populations with a range of climate responses could be targeted for protection and restoration to buffer against climate change impacts. This approach is applicable to other wide-ranging species with spatially and temporally replicated data sets.
