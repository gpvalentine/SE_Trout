# Discussion
* Our investigation combines a spatial covariance approach with a population model to measure the spatial scale of correlation and parse apart the relative strengths of three drivers of spatial synchrony in southern Appalachian brook trout.
* Based on __ observations from __ stream segments over __ years, we demonstrate several key findings: First, that brook trout experience spatial synchrony at relatively small scales, especially when compared to that of synchronous climate variables. Second, spatial synchrony can be partially, but not fully explained by climate variables. These effects differ by life stage, with winter high flows contributing most to synchrony in young-of-year brook trout. None of the three climate variables considered affected synchrony in adults. between the northern and southern subregions. Third, we characterized individual population trajectories to identify synchronous and asynchronous populations. 

## Spline Correlograms
*	Our results support prior indications that YOY Brook Trout experience higher synchrony than adults [@kanno2016].
* Correlation in log density of YOY and adult Brook Trout decayed with pairwise distance between segments, indicating that these populations are spatially autocorrelated.
* It is often assumed that spatial synchrony can operate across a species’ range, however here we see that it operates at considerably smaller scales. Our observed scales of synchrony correlate more closely to the subregional scale.
* When compared to truly synchronous processes such as regional weather, we see that spatial synchrony in Brook Trout is relatively low no matter the scale (Fig. x). This result indicates that Brook Trout populations may be relatively resilient to large-scale environmental threats.

## Population Model
### Covariate Effects on Abundance (Betas)
* Abundance of YOY Brook Trout was negatively affected by summer temperatures, winter flows, and spring flows. Average summer high temperatures in the previous year had the strongest negative effect on YOY abundance, while maximum winter and spring flows had similarly small negative effects. Our results challenge those of @kanno2016, who found that winter flow had stronger negative effects on abundance than summer temperature.
* Macrosystems research often reveals non-stationarity in covariate effects [@wiersma2022]. Our results are no different: we see that parameter estimates for environmental covariates differed in space, even changing signs depending on the subregion in question. This non-stationarity in space is evidence of cross scale interactions.
* Since average high summer temperature was that of the previous year, how could it effect YOY abundance in year $t$? Those fish weren’t born yet when the temperatures happened. We think that these effects may result from nonlethal temperature effects on the parents of the YOY. 

### Synchrony (ICCs)
SPatial synchrony was slightly higher in northern brook trout populations.

### Covariate Effects on Synchrony (C- Values)
* Flows had the strongest synchronizing effects on YOY Brook Trout. Maximum winter flow had the largest contribution to synchrony of YOY, followed by maximum spring flow. Mean high summer temperature did not significantly contribute to synchrony of YOY. Since none of the three environmental covariates considered had significant effects on adult abundance, none contributed significantly to adult synchrony.


## Ecological Interpretations
Four of the five most synchronous populations (as measured by site-specific ICC values for YOY) were located in the southwest corner of North Carolina (Fig.\@ref(fig:YOY-ICC-map)). 
* Asynchronous populations have important 
* Climate refugia are of growing importance in ecological studies. Climate refugia are typically identified by abiotic characteristics [@ashcroft2010]. In the context of fisheries and aquatics, these characteristics are typically cool and stable water temperatures and buffered flows [@cartwright2018; @isaak2015]. By measuring synchrony and asynchrony, we can identify locations and populations that are potentially resilient to environmental stressors. This allows us to identify refugia using empirical biotic evidence. 
 + A commonly identified weakness with traditional approaches to identifying refugia is that verification of refugia is seldom carried out [@barrows2020]. Our approach allows for the process of identifying refugia to be integrated with the process of validating them with empirical data.
* How does summer temperature in year t-1 effect YOY in year t? @warren2012 found that elevated summer temperatures effect spawning time and redd construction by adult brook trout. We suspect that in years and at segments with high summer water temperatures, adults spawned with lower success, reducing recruitment to the following year class.

## Limitations and Future Directions
* We attempt to account for dispersal of individuals between sites by summarizing counts and densities at the stream segment level. We assume that dispersal happens within, but not between stream segments. While individual Brook Trout have been known to migrate long distances, evidence suggests that population-level movement rarely exceeds the stream segment scale [@hudy2010; @rodriguez2002]. Future directions for this work would logically ensure spatial independence by sampling exclusively independent sites or by fitting a spatially explicit model.
* *Using precipitation as a surrogate for flow in the future*
