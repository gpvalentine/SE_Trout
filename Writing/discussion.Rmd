## Magnitude of synchrony
Climate is often considered to exert strong effects on temporal variation in animal and plant population size [@stenseth2002; @saether2004]. We hypothesized that the magnitude and scale of spatial synchrony would be similar between climate variables and trout populations, if climate exerted a strong effect on population trajectories across space. However, spatial population synchrony of the native coldwater fish was modest in both magnitude and distance, and was much weaker than that of climate variables. Initial and average correlation among observed precipitation and temperature was over twice as strong as correlation among trout populations (Fig. \@ref(fig:compound-corrgram-plot)). The climate variables were also significantly autocorrelated at far greater distances than were trout populations. The spline correlograms of estimated winter flow and YOY brook trout density showed a similar shape, with a defined dip at around 150km. The mismatch in the scale and magnitude of synchrony between abiotic drivers and biotic responses suggests that the former are not exerting strong pressure on synchrony of brook trout. The strength of spatial autocorrelation may have differed between the biotic and abiotic responses because trout populations responded to climate heterogeneously over space. In comparing the spline correlogroms of autocorrelated climate variables with those of ecosystem responses, we demonstrate a novel approach for evaluating the overall relative synchrony of populations.

It is important to recognize that inferences in population synchrony and heterogeneous responses depend inherently on geographic extent of investigations [@levin1992a; @wiens1989a], demonstrated similarly by our parallel analyses of regional versus sub-regional data. In brook trout, previous studies have reported stronger magnitude of spatial population synchrony than the current study, but they were much more limited in geographic extent (Kanno et al., 2016; Zorn & Nuhfer 2007b). Our macro-scale patterns emerged through analyses of multiple spatially and temporally replicated data sets (126 stream segments over 34 years) dispersed across approximately 1,000 km, and they provide a unique synthesis of climate vulnerability of this sensitive coldwater fish.

The strength of spatial synchrony in brook trout differed by life stage, and our results support prior indications that YOY brook trout experience higher synchrony than adults [@kanno2016]. This pattern of stronger synchrony in younger life stages is well-reflected in the literature, occurring in fish taxa from other salmonids [@cattaneo2003] to warm water and shoaling fish [@reyjol2008; @grenouillet2001]. 

## Scale of synchrony
Correlation in abundance of both YOY and adult brook trout decayed with increasing distance between segments, indicating that these populations are spatially autocorrelated. Our observed scales of synchrony correlate to roughly the subregional scale. Conservative estimates of correlation lengths in YOY and adults were 85 km and 60 km, respectively, however an inspection of the spline correlogram (Fig. \@ref(fig:compound-corrgram-plot)) shows that synchrony generally extends to 100-150km. This scale of synchrony aligns closely with other estimates for brook trout (140-170 km, @zorn2007a; @kanno2016). While synchrony in climate variables was significant beyond the regional scale considered (~500 km), we see that spatial synchrony in winter flow, winter precipitation, and brook trout density all dip in the 100-200 km range, roughly subregional scale. What could be behind this shared pattern? It is often assumed that spatial synchrony can operate across a species’ range, however here we see that it operates at considerably smaller scales.

## Drivers of abundance
Our findings support the notion that coldwater stream fish in their range edges are sensitive to extremes of temperature and flow, however we find that these effects can vary geographically and by life stage. Climate variables effected abundance of juveniles, but had little discernible effect on abundance of the adult life stage. *insert conclusive sentence about regional effects here* Abundance of YOY brook trout regionwide was negatively affected by summer temperatures, winter flows, and spring flows. Average summer high temperatures in the previous year had the strongest negative effect on YOY abundance, while maximum winter and spring flows both had small negative effects. Our results challenge those of @kanno2016, who found that winter flow had stronger negative effects on abundance than summer temperature. Subregional responses to climate differed. As hypothesized, southern populations near the edge of the native range were more susceptible to extremes of heat than were northern populations. *were northern pops particularly sensitive to anything?* We also observed a wide range of segment-specific responses to seasonal climate, evidence of strong cross-scale interactions possibly mediated by local habitat [@fridley2009]. Further work to relate local features to segment-specific responses to regional climate is ongoing.
Macrosystems research often reveals non-stationarity in covariate effects [@wiersma2022]. Our results are no different: we see that parameter estimates for climate covariates differed in space, even changing signs depending on the subregion in question. This non-stationarity in space is evidence of cross scale interactions.
* Since average high summer temperature was that of the previous year, how could it effect YOY abundance in year $t$? Those fish weren’t born yet when the temperatures happened. We think that these effects may result from nonlethal temperature effects on the parents of the YOY. 

## Drivers of synchrony
*Come back to this later*We observed weak spatial synchrony arising from varying local responses to seasonal climate. Flows had the strongest synchronizing effects on YOY brook trout. Maximum winter flow had the largest contribution to synchrony of YOY, followed by maximum spring flow. Mean high summer temperature did not significantly contribute to synchrony of YOY. Since none of the three climate covariates considered had significant effects on adult abundance, none contributed significantly to adult synchrony. 

Given these low contributions and that we only considered three climate drivers in our analysis, it's likely that outside factors created the sycnchrony and asynchrony observed here. *Come back to this too*

## Local synchrony
We calculated a derived quantity (ICC) that allowed us to measure the synchrony of each population relative to others. As with population responses to climate, spatial synchrony varied by life stage and in space. YOY brook trout experienced higher synchrony than adults, likely a result of their increased sensitivity to climate drivers. A summer heat wave or winter flood may have the capacity to synchronize abundance of a year-class broadly across space. Spatial synchrony was slightly higher in northern brook trout populations than southern populations. Spatial heterogeneity and minimal spatial structure in ICC values indicate that synchrony may be mediated by local habitat as well. A correlation analysis reveals that the YOY ICC of a population is most correlated with stream segment elevation and fall streamflow (Spearman Correlation, 0.38 and 0.35). Five of the seven most synchronous populations (as measured by site-specific ICC values for YOY) were located in the southwest corner of North Carolina (Fig.\@ref(fig:YOY-ICC-map)). Young-of-year brook trout in Shenandoah National Park also showed elevated synchrony. These values tell us that 
* Asynchronous populations have important 

## Ecological Interpretations  
When compared to truly synchronous processes such as regional weather, we see that spatial synchrony in brook trout is relatively low no matter the scale. Combined with the finding that no climate variable exerts particularly strong influence on synchrony, these result indicate that brook trout populations may be relatively resilient to large-scale climate threats. Despite minimal spatial structure in synchrony, we found that it was relatively heterogeneous across the landscape, contributing to a portfolio of synchrony [@schindler2015]. Brook trout populations characterized by asynchrony and resistance to climate variation will likely persist as the southeastern USA warms and experiences increased precipitation. 

Climate refugia are of growing importance in ecological studies. Climate refugia are typically identified by abiotic characteristics [@ashcroft2010]. In the realm of coldwater fisheries, these abiotic characteristics are typically cool and stable water temperatures and buffered flows [@cartwright2018; @isaak2015]. Our methods, however, allow us to identify refugia using empirical biotic evidence. By measuring synchrony and asynchrony, we can identify locations and populations that are potentially resilient to climate stressors. A commonly identified weakness with traditional approaches to identifying refugia is that verification of refugia is seldom carried out [@barrows2020]. By identifying potential refugia using empirical biotic, evidence, we integrate the processes of identifying and validating climate refugia.


## Limitations and Future Directions
We attempt to account for dispersal of individuals between sites by summarizing counts and densities at the stream segment level. We assume that dispersal happens within, but not between stream segments. While individual brook trout have been known to migrate long distances, evidence suggests that population-level movement rarely exceeds the stream segment scale [@hudy2010; @rodriguez2002]. Future directions for this work would logically ensure spatial independence by sampling exclusively independent sites or by fitting a spatially explicit model.

How does summer temperature in year t-1 effect YOY in year t? @warren2012 found that elevated summer temperatures effect spawning time and redd construction by adult brook trout. We suspect that in years and at segments with high summer water temperatures, adults spawned with lower success, reducing recruitment to the following year class.

One limitation of using streamflow as a predictor in population models for coldwater organisms is that measured streamflow is not widely available for headwater streams. As done in our hierarchical model, the best alternative is often to use modeled streamflow for estimates at specific locations. Another alternative is to use modeled precipitation (DAYMET, PRISM), or measured precipitation from the nearest observation location (NOAA). Precipitation is an established stand-in for streamflow [@kanno2015; @kanno2016], however it cannot account for groundwater contributions to flow and the buffering effects of local landscape (i.e. forest cover, impoundments)[@zhu2019].
