## Study Species
Brook trout are native to eastern North America, distributed from the Appalachian Mountains in northern Georgia to the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. They are culturally and economically important, the official fish of nine US states. Brook trout are a charismatic game species: trout are among the most popular freshwater sportfish in the US [@sportfishing2021]. Brook trout spawn in fall, and their eggs overwinter in streambed nests ("redds") to hatch in early spring [@hazzard1932]. They can reach maturity as early as one year of age, and seldom live longer than 3 years in their southern range [@donald1989; @meyer2006; @larson1985]. Brook Trout are highly sensitive to water temperature and cannot withstand prolonged temperatures above 22-24$^\circ$C [@eaton1995; @wehrly2007]. Spawning is deleteriously affected by high summer and fall temperatures [@warren2012]. Redds are scoured and young brook trout are swept away by high flows during winter and spring months [@kanno2015]. Because of their high environmental specificity, brook trout are an aquatic indicator species. Due  to anthropogenic activities, they have experienced large declines, particularly in their southern native range [@hudy2008].  

Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that if spatial synchrony occurs in brook trout, it is likely due to the Moran Effect. @kanno2016 found that seasonal air temperature and precipitation led to spatial synchrony in young-of-year (YOY) brook trout, but not in adults. @zorn2007a found correlations between brook trout density and spring discharge in Michigan rivers. Spatial synchrony due to the Moran Effect has been described in other stream-dwelling salmonids such as Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*) [@cattaneo2003; @lobon-cervia2007a; @zorn2007]. Despite these indications of synchrony in brook trout, prior work has been limited to single datasets [i.e., @kanno2016; @zorn2007a], and no study has attempted a broad-scale analysis of spatial synchrony in this species.

## Study Area and Dataset
Our study area comprises the far southern and eastern native range of brook trout in the USA, from the southern Appalachian Mountains in Georgia to northern Maryland (Fig. \@ref(fig:sites-map)). We compiled over 200,000 brook trout observations in 170 stream segments from nine state and federal sources in the study region between 1982 and 2015 (Table \@ref(tab:sources-table)). Conserved and managed areas such as Great Smoky Mountain National Park, Shenandoah National Park, and several long-term study segments had particularly high spatial and temporal coverage. Data consisted of individual trout, samples, and stream segments. Individual trout measurements included total length (mm) and weight (g). Sample data included date and number of electrofishing passes. Stream segment data included National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) stream segment common identifier (COMID), latitude and longitude (decimal degrees), elevation (m), length and median width (m). Study segments were located in small headwater streams (Table \@ref(tab:sites-table)). We divided the northern and southern subregions at 37.13$^\circ$ latitude – that of Radford, VA in the New River Valley [@kazyak2022].

All brook trout data were collected by backpack electrofishing in wadeable streams. A combination of single- and multi-pass sampling methods, where fish are removed from the stream in a series of upstream passes to estimate population size, were employed (single: `r round(passes_pcts.table[1,3], 1)`%, multi: `r round(passes_pcts.table[2,3], 1)`%). Standardized sampling protocols for the southern US region were followed [@sdafstroutcommittee1992]. This included the use of block nets or cobble dams to serve as barriers for movement in or out of the reach being sampled. Depending on stream width, one to three backpack electrofishing units were used. A majority of sampling occurred in annual surveys conducted at the same site in June - October. Samples taken in lakes and ponds, as well as observations of hatchery-born fish, were excluded. We also excluded segments with less than 10% brook trout in fish assemblages. YOY brook trout were defined as those <= 90 mm total length, and adults were defined as those >90 mm total length. We summarized the data to counts by life stage by sample occasion and electrofishing pass. 

To spatially match trout data with predictors, we pooled trout count and surface area surveyed across sites when multiple sites were surveyed annually in an NHDPlus stream segment (a length of a stream delineated by either its beginning and a confluence, or by two confluences [@USGS2016]; average segment length = 3.3 km). This further ensured sufficient sample sizes for analysis. Brook trout in headwaters typically remain within several hundred meters of their hatching locations [@hudy2010; @rodriguez2002]. Thus, we pooled count data by stream segment to ascertain demographic independence among segments and account for spatial autocorrelation within segments. On average, 34% of stream segments contained more than one collection site.

## Correlogram Analysis
We quantified the scale of spatial synchrony in YOY and adult brook trout using the nonparametric spatial covariance function in the 'ncf' package for R [@bjornstad2022; @bjornstad2001; @rcoreteam2022]. We then extracted estimates of both initial and average spatial correlation and the distances to which spatial covariance extends. We defined the scale of synchrony as the distance at which the correlation between two segments is significantly higher than the sample average. This scale is commonly referred to as correlation length [@bjornstad2001]. We visually represented synchrony using spline correlograms, which portray the spatial decay in pairwise correlation between segments. The correlation length can be interpreted as the shortest distance at which the confidence envelope of the spline function intercepts the x-axis. We selected segments with $\geq$ 5 years of data (hereafter “long term segments”). We further filtered for observations between 1995 and 2015, where density of surveys was highest. Lastly, for this analysis we considered only multipass electrofishing data, which allows abundance estimates based on depletion. This left 74 stream segments for the analysis of both YOY and adult life stages. The YOY-only analysis included counts from 66 segments, while the adult-only analysis included counts from 68 segments from the same time period. We conducted the correlogram analysis of the two life stages at the regional and subregional levels. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for the correlograms using the bootstrap algorithm in the 'ncf' package. We truncated pairwise lag distances to 2/3 the total distance observed following @fletcher2018. 

Abundances at each sample were predicted using the 'FSA' package for R [@ogle2022]. Using these predicted abundances, we calculated the natural log of average density (fish/1000 m$^2$) at each stream segment and year. For segments and years where data were not collected (47% of observations), we substituted mean log density for the given segment during the study period. A simulation study detailed in Appendix \@ref(simulation-for-missing-data-in-correlogram-analysis) demonstrates that imputation of segment means for 47% of data does not significantly change interpretations of correlograms as compared 0% missing data.  

We compared the magnitude and scale of spatial synchrony in brook trout to those of common climate influences on brook trout populations, including mean summer water and air temperature and winter streamflow and precipitation [@kanno2015; @kanno2016]. Observed summer (June-September) air and water temperatures were obtained from the US Forest Service [@li2016a], and were measured using a network of 204 paired temperature loggers located in brook trout streams in the southeast US from 2011 to 2015 (Fig. \@ref(fig:temp-sites-map)). Winter (December - February) streamflow estimates were obtained from the NHDPlus V2 [@USGS2016] for the stream segments in question. Hourly observed winter precipitation (2008 - 2014) was obtained for 51 NOAA NCEI measurement sites within the geographic extent of the trout data [Fig. \@ref(fig:temp-sites-map), @noaa2022] and summarized to total precipitation for each winter (December - February). 

## Hierarchical Model
We used two Bayesian hierarchical models to infer synchrony in brook trout populations and to identify climate drivers of synchronous dynamics [@berliner1996; @wikle1998]. For both, we used an N-mixture model [@royle2004] coupled with a log linear process model. In the first, hereafter the random effects model, we inferred brook trout count as a function of a temporal random effect and a spatiotemporal random effect. In the second, hereafter the climate effects model, we inferred brook trout count as a function of summer temperature and winter and spring streamflow. We elected to use separate models for climate and random effects after encountering convergence issues using a single model. We analyzed counts of brook trout abundance from 170 long term stream segments over a 34-year period from 1982 to 2015.

Adapting the standard N-mixture model to allow our removal sampling data at unique segment $i = 1,...,n$, and year $t = 1,...,T$ for each of $j = 1,...,3$ electrofishing passes, we specify the data model

\begin{equation}
  y_{i,j,t} \sim 
    \begin{cases}
      \text{binomial}(N_{i,t}, p_s) & \text{if } j = 1\\
      \text{binomial}(N_{i,t} - \sum_{j=2}^{3}y_{i,j,t}, p_s) & \text{if } j > 1\,,
    \end{cases}
  (\#eq:observationModel)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $y_{i,j,t}$ is observed count of YOY or adult brook trout at segment $i$, pass $j$, and year $t$. We denote $n_{i,t}$ as the predicted count of the given life stage in year $t$ at segment $i$. The term $p_s$ represents the capture probability (of individuals) for data source $s = 1, ...,S$. $\bm{p}$ arises from the informed priors $\bm{p}$ ~ $\text{beta}(0.5, 0.1)$ for YOY and $\bm{p}$ ~ $\text{beta}(0.65, 0.1)$ for adults, based their differences in capture probability [@kanno2015]. We allow capture probability to vary by source because sampling crew measurement is often a large source of variation in sampling efficiency [@hughes2002; @kimmel2006; @meador2005]. We model abundance separately for passes $j > 1$ because there are $\sum_{j=2}^{3}y_{i,j,t}$ fewer individuals in the population after removing them in each pass. We modeled abundance in each pass conditional on local density $\lambda_{i,t}$ (fish/1000m$^2$) as

\begin{equation}
  N_{i,t} \sim \text{Poisson}\left(\frac{a_{i,t}}{1000}\lambda_{i,t}\right)\,,
  (\#eq:processModel1)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $a_{i,t}$ is the sum of site areas (length $*$ median wetted width) sampled for the given stream segment and year. For the random effects model, local density was represented as a function of segment-specific intercept and two random effects:

\begin{equation}
  \text{log}(\lambda_{i,t}) = \omega_i + \epsilon_t + \gamma_{i,t}\,
  (\#eq:processModel2)
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\omega_i$ represents average log density at segment $i$ with the noninformative prior $\omega_i \sim \text{normal}(0, 1000)$. The terms $\epsilon_t$ and $\gamma_{i,t}$ represent spatially- and spatiotemporally-structured random effects, respectively. The random effects are assumed to be independent with distributions $\epsilon_t \sim \text{normal}(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon), \sigma^2_\epsilon \sim \text{uniform}(0, 10)$, $\gamma_{i,t} \sim \text{normal}(0, \sigma^2_{\gamma,i})$ and $\sigma_{\gamma,i} \sim \text{uniform}(0, 10)$. The $\epsilon_t$ term represents the between-year variation in density that is synchronous to all segments, and the $\gamma_{i,t}$ term represents the variation that is segment-specific (i.e., asynchronous). 

Following @grosbois2009 and @lahoz-monfort2011, we then used posterior samples of the estimated variances of the two random effect terms to derive a segment-specific intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC):

\begin{equation}
  ICC_i = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_\epsilon}{\hat{\sigma}^2_\epsilon + \hat{\sigma}^2_{\gamma,i}}\,.
  (\#eq:ICC)
\end{equation}

\noindent The ICC serves as a measure of synchrony of the local population in segment $i$ relative to the population as a whole. Large ICC values indicate that the given segment is synchronous with the larger population, while small ICC values indicate asynchrony. We created semivariograms of YOY and adult ICC values to check for spatial structure. 

For the climate effects model, local density was represented as a function of three climate covariates. Daily temperature predictions for each stream segment were obtained from the DAYMET model [@thornton2014; @thornton1997; @thornton2021] using the 'daymetr' package in R [@hufkens2018]. Monthly flow predictions for each stream segment were obtained from the NHDPlus V2 [@USGS2016]. We summarized summer high temperature as the mean of daily 90th percentile estimates between June and September. We summarized winter (December - February) and spring (March - May) high flows as maximum of monthly 90th percentile flow estimates. All climate covariates were centered and scaled by stream segment. Density was modeled as a function of these covariates $\bm{x}_{i,t}$ using the log-link function

\begin{equation}
  \text{log}(\lambda_{i,t}) = \omega_i + \bm{x}'_{i,t}\bm{\beta}_i,
  (\#eq:processModel3)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\omega_i$ represents average log density at segment $i$ when climate variables are set at their mean and $\bm{\beta}_i$ represents a vector of site-specific climate covariate effects. Priors on $\alpha_i$ and $\bm{\beta_}i$ were noninformative: $\alpha_i \sim \text{normal}(0, 1000)$ and $\bm{\beta}_i \sim \text{normal}(\bm{\mu}_\beta, \bm{\sigma}^2_\beta)$ where $\bm{\mu}_\beta \sim \text{normal}(0, 100)$ and $\bm{\sigma}_\beta \sim \text{uniform}(0, 10)$. As a random effect, $\bm{\beta}_i$ allows the estimation of both local and overall covariate effects.

The synchronizing effects of the climate covariates can be estimated from the ranges of the covariate coefficients ($\bm{\beta}_i$s). A coefficient with small range (that is, similar effects on different populations) is one that has a strong synchronizing effect. A covariate with a large range (differing effects on different populations) is one with weak synchronizing effect.

We fit a total of twelve models: One random effect and one climate effects model each for YOY and adults at the regional scale fit to all stream segments (hereafter the “regional” models), as well as one random effect model and one climate effect model each for YOY and adults in the northern and southern halves of the study region, hereafter the “subregional” models. We implemented our models utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using JAGS with the 'jagsUI' package in R [@kellner2021]. We provide code in online supplements. After a burn-in period of 5,000 samples for the covariate models and 20,000 for random effects models, three chains were run until 25,000 and 50,000 iterations were reached, respectively. All chains converged, as visually evaluated using trace plots. To evaluate the performance of our models, we completed posterior predictive checks for the test statistics of mean and coefficient of variation. These checks test for lack of fit using Bayesian $p$ values, defined as the probability that simulated data are more extreme than the observed data [@gelman2004]. Using this method, models with a lack of fit produce Bayesian $p$ values close to 0 or 1. We report posterior means as point estimates and 95% highest posterior density credible intervals as estimates of uncertainty.
