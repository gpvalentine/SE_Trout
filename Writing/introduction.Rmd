# Introduction

## Macrosystems ecology & cross-scale interactions
* Many environmental processes and biological responses occur at macrosystem (i.e. regional , continental) scales. Likewise, ecological patterns cross scales from the macro to the local. Ecological research at macrosystem scales is relatively rare, but accelerating in recent years.
* Macrosystems research often requires integrating datasets at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Thus, macrosystem ecology is often a data integration issue.

## Spatial heterogeneity in stream systems
* Stream systems offer a unique opportunity for the study of macrosystems ecology, multi-scale interactions, and spatial synchrony [@mccluney2014].
  + Stream systems have an innate hierarchical structure that can range from the reach scale to the continental scale. They can include everything from complex headwater networks to large, simple, and linearized channels. Importantly, stream communities are often tied to the scale and structure of their networks, as summarized in the river continuum concept [@vannote1980].
* Due to this complex spatial structure, stream systems also offer unique challenges.
  + Because stream biota are largely restricted to dendritic networks, terrestrial assumptions of movement and distance do not apply.
* While classical studies in stream ecology typically treat in longitudinally-distributed reaches, those small features of course connect to form paths, rivers, and watersheds. Ecological processes at small scales therefore combine to form cumulative and emergent processes at large scales. Macrosystems stream ecology is therefore a discipline with inhereent cross-scale interactions [@heffernan2014].

## Synchrony
* One biological response to cross-scale drivers is spatial synchrony, the autocorrelation of population dynamics across space.
* Populations exhibiting spatial synchrony are at higher risk of global extinction compared to those not exhibiting spatial synchrony [@heino1997]. This is because demographic rescue is less likely among synchronous subpopulations when they are doing poorly.
* Conversely, asynchrony in populations results in a reduced probability of extinction. Asynchronous populations may be more resilient in the face of climate change.
* Synchrony contributes to metapopulation dynamics. It can be reasoned that a landscape of asynchronous populations, or at the least a “portfolio” of synchrony across the landscape, would lead to the most resilient metapopulations [@schindler2010].
* The strength and scale of spatial synchrony have critical implications for species persistence. A deeper understanding of synchrony can help managers better conserve their target organisms. With estimates of the scale of spatial synchrony, managers can plan conservation measures at biologically relevant scales. With drivers of synchrony identified, managers can implement restoration measures to limit these drivers. 

* ~~Humans have been fascinated by synchronous population dynamics for millennia. Both the Bible and Quran tell of plagues of locusts, while both Shakespear and Chaucer mentioned masts of acorns in their writings [@koenig2021].~~
* ~~One of the first modern ecologists to describe this pattern was Charles Elton, who described large-scale global fluctuations in mammal populations [@elton1925].~~
* ~~Tobler's First Law of Geography states that all things are related, but nearer things are more related than farther things [@tobler1970]. Many populations exhibit these characteristics, where correlated dynamics decay with distance.~~
  + ~~This is spatial synchrony, the autocorrelation of population dynamics across space.~~
* ~~Spatial synchrony has been documented in practically all major taxonomic groups, and is typically attributed to three causes [@koenig1999; @liebhold2004]: 1) dispersal of individuals from populations at high density to those at low density [@ranta1995], 2) predators that switch between populations at high density [@ydenberg1987], and 3) the Moran effect, when environmental influences impose synchrony on populations [@moran1953].~~

## Transition
* Here, we explore spatial synchrony in Brook Trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*), a threatened salmonid.
* We combine a spatial covariance approach with a population model to better understand the scales and drivers of spatial synchrony in southern Appalachian Brook Trout.
* Our aims were threefold: 1) Approximate the scale at which spatial synchrony exists in southern Appalachian Brook Trout, 2) ascertain environmental factors that drive spatial synchrony in these populations, and 3) identify highly synchronous and asynchronous populations of conservation interest. Our study populations inhabit the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia. We evaluate spatial synchrony both across this region and within its northern and southern subregions.
* Our analysis, based on thousands of individual observations from more than 100 sites, provides novel insight into the scales and drivers of spatial synchrony in Brook Trout in the Southeast US, as well as insight into the spatial distribution of both synchronous and asynchronous populations.
