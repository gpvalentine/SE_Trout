# Introduction

Populations commonly experience shared temporal variation in abundance or demographic rates across a landscape. This so-called spatial synchrony is the strongest between spatially close populations due to shared abiotic conditions and biotic processes such as movement and predation [@koenig1999; @liebhold2004]. Spatial synchrony has been reported in a large area in some animals and plants (~1,000 km [@koenig1998]), indicating that broad-scale abiotic drivers can generate spatially homogeneous population responses. As climate change accelerates, understanding the scale and drivers of spatial synchrony is critical to range-wide species conservation. However, this knowledge is limited even for well-studies species due to lack of long-term population data replicated across populations over a large spatial extent and challenges of separating climate effects on population synchrony from other synchronizing factors such as animal movement and predation.   

Although spatial synchrony is common in animals and plants, local populations, even those in close geographical proximity, do not always display synchronous population trajectories. Heterogeneous population responses result not only because the magnitude of environmental drivers differs over space but also because the capacity to buffer against them differs locally. This cross-scale interaction between a broad-scale driver (e.g., climate) and local populations occurs due to features such as springs, local topography, etc. [@mclaughlin2017; @fridley2009] As a result, some sites have asynchronous population trajectories that differ from a majority of populations with similar population trajectories. However, little empirical knowledge exists about how synchronous and asynchronous populations are distributed in wide-ranging species occupying a large landscape.

Stream systems offer a unique opportunity for the study of macrosystems processes such as spatial synchrony and cross-scale interactions [@mccluney2014]. Their high spatial heterogeneity and network geometry mean that their communities are sensitive to disturbance and stress [@benda2004]. Watersheds concentrate precipitation through narrow channels, while the physical properties of water exacerbate thermal and toxic effects on organisms. Many aquatic communities are restricted by the dendritic shapes of stream networks and their one-directional flow. Habitat complexity and human impacts further limit connectivity within these systems. Streams experience multiple- and cross-scale processes: reaches combine to form streams and rivers, which in turn make watersheds. These longitudinal connections mean that disturbances in one reach can have effects far downstream. Ecological processes at small scales therefore combine to form cumulative and emergent processes at large scales. This combination of factors means that spatial synchrony may readily arise in stream systems.  

Fish populations inhabiting lotic ecosystems are particularly sensitive to stream temperature and flow. Both are considered key physical drivers of stream community dynamics [@poff1997]. Atmospheric air temperature, a key driver and common stand-in for stream temperature, has increased dramatically in the last century and is predicted to further increase in the coming century [@portner2022]. In the southeast USA, climate change is bringing increased drought punctuated by extreme flood events [@alipour2020; @kunkel2003]. Depending on the species and system, stream fish respond to both high and low extremes of these forces [@mccullough2009; @perry2009; @young2011]. Climate effects on stream fish also vary by life stage and season. Juvenile fish are sensitive to changes in streamflow: summer discharge and stable flows result in increased growth and abundance, while scouring flows during winter and spring can wash away eggs and fry [@schlosser1985; @kovach2016; @cattaneo2002; @strange1993; @kanno2015]. Among adults, high water temperatures can result in increased stress and direct mortality, as well as impact the timing and quality of spawning [@kovach2016; @warren2012]. As climatic changes worsen these effects, stream fish occupying marginal habitat at the extremes of their ranges will be extirpated.  

Here, we characterize the population structure, scales, and climate drivers of spatial synchrony by life stage (i.e., young-of-the-year and adults) among populations of an iconic native coldwater fish (Brook trout, *Salvelinus fontinalis*) at their southern native range limit, in the eastern USA. Remnant populations of this salmonid in the study region occur in small, isolated headwaters, which limit potential for dispersal among populations. Furthermore, predation impacts are low, precluding two factors that might otherwise synchronize population trajectories over space. Brook trout are highly sensitive to environmental drivers such as stream temperature and flow [xu2010a; @warren2012; @roghair2002; xu2010a]. Consequently, this species provides a fitting opportunity to investigate population synchrony attributable mainly to climate variation.  

Our study aims were threefold. First, we quantified the scale at which spatial synchrony occurs among their populations and compared it with the scales of spatial synchrony in climate variables (i.e., temperature and flow). We hypothesized that the scales of spatial synchrony would be similar between the climate variables and trout populations, if climate variables exerted a strong effect on population trajectories across space. Second, we tested whether spatial synchrony was explained by a set of seasonal climate variables and whether the importance of seasonal climate variables differed by northern versus southern populations in the study region. Because we studied a sensitive coldwater species at the southern range limit, we predicted that temperature would be a stronger driver of synchrony in southern populations compared to northern populations. Furthermore, we predicted that stream flow would be a stronger driver of synchrony in young-of-the-year stage versus adult stage due to the diminished ability to withstand bed-scouring high flows of the former stage. Third, we quantified site-specific population trajectories relative to the overall trajectory across sites to characterize how synchronous and asynchronous populations are distributed in the landscape. Asynchronous populations that deviate from the overall trajectory may hold conservation values when asynchrony is due to population resistance and resiliency in environmental changes. To address these aims, we assembled time-series abundance data at > 100 sites spanning a nearly 1,000 km distributional stretch of brook trout habitat in the south and central eastern USA.
