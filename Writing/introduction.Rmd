Populations commonly experience shared temporal variation in abundance or demographic rates across a landscape. This so-called spatial synchrony is the strongest between spatially close populations due to spatially autocorrelated abiotic conditions (Moran Effect; @moran1953; @grenfell1998; @hansen2013; @kelly1994; @peltonen2002) and biotic processes such as movement and predation [@koenig1999; @liebhold2004; @ranta1995]. Spatially homogeneous population responses have been reported across broad distances in some animals and plants (~1,000 km [@koenig1998; @post2002; @ranta1997]). Such broad-scale response is attributed to continental and regional climate patterns, which are key drivers of demographic rates [@koenig2002; @stenseth2002]. Climate processes and ecosystem responses logically play out at similar scales [@levin1992a; @wiens1989a]. Therefore, the shared spatial scale of synchrony between climate drivers and population responses is typically regarded as a sign of the Moran Effect [@koenig1999; @moran1953]. As climate change accelerates, understanding the scale and drivers of spatial synchrony is critical to range-wide species conservation and management [@hansen2020].

Spatial synchrony as a result of climate is common in animals and plants, however local populations, even those in close geographical proximity, do not always display synchronous population trajectories between each other and with the environment [@herfindal2022; @sutcliffe1996]. Heterogeneous population responses result not only because the magnitude of environmental drivers differs over space but also because the capacity to buffer against them differs locally. This cross-scale interaction between a broad-scale driver (e.g., climate) and local populations can occur due to the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity created by features such as local topography, microclimate variation, and surface-groundwater exchange among others [@mclaughlin2017; @fridley2009]. As a result, the strength of cross-scale interactions determines how synchronously or asynchronously a set of local populations respond to broad-scale drivers [@granzotti2022]. A portfolio of asynchronous population trajectories buffers species from range-wide declines [@heino1997; @roy2005], stabilizes population size over time at the regional scale [@schindler2010; @schindler2015; @wilcox2017a]), and increases socioeconomic resilience of the resource users [e.g., hunters and anglers; @cline2022]. However, little empirical knowledge exists about how synchronous and asynchronous populations are distributed in wide-ranging species occupying a large landscape.

Stream systems offer a unique opportunity for the study of macrosystems processes such as spatial synchrony and cross-scale interactions [@mccluney2014]. Streams are inherently characterized by spatial autocorrelation because environmental patterns and processes downstream are influenced by those upstream due to unidirectional flow [@isaak2017; @lloyd2005; @peterson2006a]. However, these processes are typically counteracted by spatial heterogeneity and network geometry created by stream confluences [@boddy2019; @terui2018]. Confluences represent geomorphic breaks where physical habitat characteristics such stream size, temperature, and channel slope change abruptly, creating spatial heterogeneity in stream networks [@benda2004]. Consequently, stream habitat is often characterized and classified from confluence to confluence (i.e., by stream segment). This is also the finest spatial grain at which stream habitat data are available at the national and continental scale (e.g., National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) data set in the USA). Stream confluences are more numerous and average segment length is shorter in the headwaters than farther downstream in stream networks [@wohl2017]. Therefore, headwater stream networks contain habitat heterogeneity over relatively short physical distances, providing a template on which cross-scale interactions can occur.

Globally, headwater streams harbor a significant portion of remaining populations of coldwater fish (e.g., trout and salmon), which are particularly sensitive to variation in stream temperature and flow [@kovach2016a]. Both are considered key abiotic drivers of stream biota dynamics [@maheu2016; @poff1997]. Atmospheric air temperature, a key driver and common stand-in for stream temperature, has increased dramatically in the last century and is predicted to further increase in the coming century [@portner2022]. In the southeast USA, climate change is bringing increased precipitation punctuated by extreme flood events [@alipour2020; @ingram2013]. Coldwater fish species respond to both high temperatures and high extremes of streamflow [@goode2013; @mccullough2009; @santiago2017]. Climate effects on stream fish also vary by life stage and season. Juvenile fish are particularly sensitive to changes in streamflow: Summer discharge and stable flows result in increased growth and abundance, while scouring flows during incubation and emergence can wash away eggs and fry [@schlosser1985; @kovach2016; @cattaneo2002; @strange1993; @kanno2015]. As stronger swimmers, adults are less sensitive to high streamflow, however high water temperatures can result in increased stress and direct mortality, as well as impact the timing and quality of spawning [@kovach2016; @warren2012]. As climatic changes amplify these effects, stream fish occupying marginal habitat at the extremes of their ranges will risk extirpation.  

We characterized the scales, structure, and climate drivers of spatial synchrony by life stage (i.e., young-of-the-year and adults) among populations of an iconic native coldwater fish (Brook trout, *Salvelinus fontinalis*) at their southern native range limit, in the eastern USA. Remnant populations of this salmonid in the study region occur in small, isolated headwaters [@kazyak2022], which limit potential for dispersal among populations. Furthermore, predation impacts are low as many populations occur in allopatry [@hudy2008], precluding two factors that might otherwise synchronize population trajectories over space. Brook trout are highly sensitive to climate drivers such as stream temperature and flow [@xu2010a; @warren2012; @roghair2002]. Consequently, this species provides an opportunity to investigate population synchrony attributable mainly to climate variation. 

Our study aims were threefold. First, we quantified the scale and strength of spatial synchrony among brook trout populations and compared it with those of spatial synchrony in climate variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and streamflow). We hypothesized that patterns of spatial synchrony would be similar between the climate variables and trout populations, if climate variables exerted a strong effect on population trajectories across space [@koenig1999; @levin1992a; @wiens1989a]. Second, we tested whether spatial synchrony was explained by a set of seasonal climate variables and whether the importance of seasonal climate variables differed by northern versus southern populations in the study region. Because we studied a sensitive coldwater species at the southern range limit, we predicted that temperature would be a stronger driver of synchrony in southern populations compared to northern populations. Furthermore, we predicted that stream flow would be a stronger driver of synchrony in young-of-the-year stage versus adult stage due to the diminished ability to withstand bed-scouring high flows of the former stage [@kanno2016; @kovach2016]. Third, we quantified site-specific population trajectories relative to the overall trajectory across sites to characterize how synchronous and asynchronous populations are distributed in the landscape. Asynchronous populations that deviate from the overall trajectory may hold conservation value when asynchrony is due to population resistance and resiliency to environmental changes [@schindler2015]. To address these aims, we assembled time-series abundance data at > 100 sites spanning a more than 100,000 km$^2$ distributional stretch of brook trout habitat in the south and central eastern USA.
