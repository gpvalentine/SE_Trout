## Simulation for Missing Data in Correlogram Analysis
A simulation study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of interpreting correlograms created using a dataset with a large percentage of imputed values for missing data. Due to irregular sampling by managers and limited multipass electrofishing data, the time series of yearly brook trout densities was missing 47% of values. We chose to impute these missing values with the mean density in the given segment during the 20 year time period of interest (1995-2015). Here, we simulate spatially-autocorrelated datasets with 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% missing data, comparing the resulting correlograms.

```{r Corrgram_MissingData_Sim, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

set.seed(1234)

### Simulate 0 pct missingness data at 100 sites over 2 years
x <- expand.grid(1:20, 1:5)[, 1]
y <- expand.grid(1:20, 1:5)[, 2]
# true range (p) is 2 under Gaussian covariance function
Z <- cbind(rmvn.spa(x=x, y=y, p=2, method="gaus"),
  rmvn.spa(x=x, y=y, p=2, method="gaus"))
# Fit correlogram

plot0 <- ~plot(fit0)
m0.summary <- summary(fit0)

### 25 pct missingness
Z.m25 <- Z
Z.m25[sample(length(x), 0.25*length(x))] <- NA
for (i in 1:nrow(Z)) {
  idx.tmp <- which(is.na(Z.m25[i, ]))

  }

fit25 <- Sncf(x=x, y=y, z=Z.m25, resamp=1E3, quiet = T)

for (i in 1:nrow(Z)) {
  idx.tmp <- which(is.na(Z.m50[i, ]))

  }
}
# Fit correlogram
fit50 <- Sncf(x=x, y=y, z=Z.m50, resamp=1E3, quiet = T)
plot50 <- ~plot(fit50)
m50.summary <- summary(fit50)

### 75 pct missingness
Z.m75 <- Z
Z.m75[sample(length(x), 0.75*length(x))] <- NA
for (i in 1:nrow(Z)) {
  idx.tmp <- which(is.na(Z.m75[i, ]))
  if (length(idx.tmp>0)) {
    Z.m75[i, idx.tmp] <- mean(Z.m75[i, ], na.rm=TRUE)
  }
}
# Fit correlogram
fit75 <- Sncf(x=x, y=y, z=Z.m75, resamp=1E3, quiet = T)
plot75 <- ~plot(fit75)
m75.summary <- summary(fit75)

## Make a compound plot
SimStudy_compound.plot <- plot_grid(plot0, plot25, plot50, plot75,
                          labels = c("a)", "b)", "c)", "d)"))
```

```{r sim-study-plot, fig.cap="Spline correlogram of a datasets with a) 0%, b) 25%, c) 50%, and d) 75% missingness over 2 years at 100 sites. Grey shading represents 95% confidence interval. Grey line represents mean correlation.", fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
SimStudy_compound.plot
```

Comparing the four simulations, we see that the 95% confidence interval grows when increasing amounts of missing data are imputed with means. Mean pairwise correlation estimates do not significantly differ between the first three simulations (0%: `r round(m0.summary$Regional.synch, 2)`, (`r round(m0.summary$Squantile[[2]], 2)`, `r round(m0.summary$Squantile[[6]], 2)`), 25%: `r round(m25.summary$Regional.synch, 2)`, (`r round(m25.summary$Squantile[[2]], 2)`, `r round(m25.summary$Squantile[[6]], 2)`), 50%: `r round(m50.summary$Regional.synch, 2)`, (`r round(m50.summary$Squantile[[2]], 2)`, `r round(m50.summary$Squantile[[6]], 2)`)). Neither do estimates of the distance at which pairwise correlation reaches 0 (0%: `r round(m0.summary$estimates[1,1], 2)`, (`r round(m0.summary$quantiles[2,1], 2)`, `r round(m0.summary$quantiles[6,1], 2)`), 25%: `r round(m25.summary$estimates[1,1], 2)`, (`r round(m25.summary$quantiles[2,1], 2)`, `r round(m25.summary$quantiles[6,1], 2)`), 50%: `r round(m50.summary$estimates[1,1], 2)`, (`r round(m50.summary$quantiles[2,1], 2)`, `r round(m50.summary$quantiles[6,1], 2)`)). We take this as evidence that imputing 44% missing data with site mean density does not considerably effect interpretations of the magnitude or scale of spatial synchrony.

## Simulation for Combined Model
We developed a simulation to evaluate the identifiability of a model with both climate effects and random effects. We simulated 3-pass electrofishing data for 100 stream segments over 20 years, and evaluated with an an N-mixture model using a removal mechanism coupled with a log linear process model. We simulated one spatially heterogeneous climate covariate and both temporal and spatiotemporal random effects. Detection probability was the same for all simulated stream segments.

Sites were located in randomly selected subwatersheds identified as capable of supporting populations of brook trout [*Salvelinus fontinalis*, @ebtjv2006]. Located at the downstream outlet of the subwatersheds, at each site a logger underwater was paired with a logger affixed to the bank or a tree. Stream and air temperatures were measured every 30 minutes using remote loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA 02532). Loggers were deployed from 2011 to 2015. Source: USDA Forest Service.

In multi-pass sampling, fish were removed from the stream in successive passes in temporarily blocked stream reaches to estimate capture probability and thus population size. Sampling boundaries were defined by block nets or cobble dams which serve as barriers for fish movement. Depending on stream width, one to three backpack electrofishing units were used.
