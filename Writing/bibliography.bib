  abstract = {This case study assessed the environmental and social impact of bicycle frames made from wild Ghanaian bamboo. The environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of the bamboo frame was compared to the LCA results of an aluminium frame and a steel frame. The results show that the overall environmental impact of the bamboo bicycle frame is about 50\% less than aluminium and about 30\% less than steel bicycle frames in all impact categories, except Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity and Terrestrial Ecotoxicity. Impacts in these two categories were contributed by the use and disposal of Dursban which was used to preserve bamboo culms. Performance in these impact categories could be improved by preserving bamboo with Borax. For the social life cycle assessment (S-LCA), this case study used a simplified approach to social impact assessment at the subcategory level. The results show that the Ghanaian bamboo bicycle companies performed well and made no negative socio-economic impacts in most subcategories. Even so, companies could have made the bamboo resource owners aware of the value of bamboo so that they could negotiate a good price to contribute to the development of the communities. The extraction of bamboo might be a hot spot. Unlike environmental LCA, S-LCA is new and its methodology is not standardised. This study identified challenges that emerge in applying S-LCA in small and medium scale enterprises in the developing countries where data can be limiting. The simplified approach used in this study can be adopted to assess other products. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Understanding flash flood characteristics is essential for mitigating the associated risks and implementing proactive risk management strategies. In this study, flash flood characteristics including frequency, duration, and intensity are assessed in addition to their associated property damages. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events database as well as hourly precipitation data of the North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase-2 (NLDAS-2) are utilised, and more than 14,000 flash flood events during 1996\textendash 2017 are analysed. Flash flood hazard is investigated at county, state, and regional levels across the SEUS. Results indicate increasing pattern for the frequency and intensity of flash flooding over the SEUS. The frequency of flash flooding is found to be higher in spring and summer, whereas the duration and intensity of events are higher during winter and fall, respectively. The western parts of the SEUS are prone to more frequent and intense flash flooding compared to the eastern parts. Overall, our analyses suggest that flash flood hazard in Louisiana is higher than other states in the SEUS.},

The term `refugia' is commonly used without distinguishing between macrorefugia and microrefugia, ex situ refugia and in situ refugia, glacial and interglacial refugia or refugia based on habitat stability and refugia based on climatic stability. It is not always clear which definition is being used, and this makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of the methods employed. For example, it is crucial to develop accurate fine-scale climate grids when identifying microrefugia, but coarse-scale macroclimate might be adequate for determining macrorefugia. Similarly, identifying in situ refugia might be more appropriate for species with poor dispersal ability but this may overestimate the extinction risk for good dispersers. More care needs to be taken to properly define the context when referring to refugia from climate change so that the validity of methods and the conservation significance of refugia can be assessed.},

  abstract = {After flagellar detachment in Chlamydomonas reinhardi, there is a rapid synthesis and accumulation of mRNAs for tubulin and other flagellar proteins. Maximum levels of these mRNAs (flagellar RNAs) are reached within 1 h after deflagellation, after which they are rapidly degraded to their predeflagellation levels. The degradation of alpha- and beta-tubulin RNAs was shown to be due to the shortening of their half-lives after accumulation (Baker et al., J. Cell Biol. 99:2074-2081, 1984). Deflagellation in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors results in the accumulation of tubulin and other flagellar mRNAs by kinetics similar to those of controls. However, unlike controls, in which the accumulated mRNAs are rapidly degraded, these mRNAs are stabilized in cycloheximide. The stabilization by cycloheximide is specific for the flagellar mRNAs accumulated after deflagellation, since there is no change in the levels of flagellar mRNAs in nondeflagellated (uninduced) cells in the presence of cycloheximide. The kinetics of flagellar mRNA synthesis after deflagellation are shown to be the same in cycloheximide-treated and control cells by in vivo labeling and in vitro nuclear runoff experiments. These results show that protein synthesis is not required for the induced synthesis of flagellar mRNAs, and that all necessary transcriptional control factors are present in the cell before deflagellation, but that protein synthesis is required for the accelerated degradation of the accumulated flagellar mRNAs. Since cycloheximide prevents the induced synthesis and accumulation of flagellar proteins, it is possible that the product(s) of protein synthesis required for the accelerated decay of these mRNAs is a flagellar protein(s). The possibility that one or more flagellar proteins autoregulate the stability of the flagellar mRNAs is discussed.},

Identification of refugia typically includes modeling the distribution of a species' current habitat and then extrapolating that distribution given projected changes in temperature and precipitation, or by mapping topographic features that buffer species from regional climate extremes. However, the function of those hypothesized refugia must be validated (or challenged) with independent data not used in the initial identification of the refugia. Although doing so would facilitate the incorporation of climate-change refugia into conservation and management decision making, a synthesis of validation methods is currently lacking. We reviewed the literature and defined four methods to test refugia predictions. We propose that such bottom-up approaches can lead to improved protected-area designations and on-the-ground management actions to reduce influences from non-climate stressors within potential refugia.},

The thermal sensitivity (TS), based on relationship between air temperature (Ta) and Tw, of a given stream can be used for quantifying the streams sensitivity to future climate change. This study aims to compare TS for a wide range of temperate streams located within a large French catchment (110,000 km2) using 4 years of hourly data (2008\textendash 2012) and to cluster stations sharing similar thermal variabilities and thereby identify environmental key drivers that modify TS at the regional scale. Two successive classifications were carried out: (a) first based on Ta\textendash Tw relationship metrics including TS and (b) second to establish a link between a selection of environmental variables and clusters of stations. Based on weekly Ta\textendash Tw relationships, the first classification identified four thermal regimes with differing annual Tw in terms of magnitude and amplitudes in comparison with Ta. The second classification, based on classification and regression tree method, succeeded to link each thermal regime to different environmental controlling factors. Streams influenced by both groundwater inflows and shading are the most moderated with the lowest TS and an annual amplitude of Tw around half of the annual amplitude of Ta. Inversely, stations located on large streams with a high distance from source and not (or slightly) influenced by groundwater inflows nor shading showed the highest TS, and so, they are very climate sensitive. These findings have implications for guiding river basin managers and other stakeholders in implementing thermal moderation measures in the context of a warming climate and global change.},

Abrupt changes in water and sediment flux occur at channel confluences in river networks and trigger changes in channel and floodplain morphology. This observation, when taken in the context of a river network as a population of channels and their confluences, allows the development of testable predictions about how basin size, basin shape, drainage density, and network geometry interact to regulate the spatial distribution of physical diversity in channel and riparian attributes throughout a river basin. The spatial structure of river networks also regulates how stochastic watershed disturbances influence the morphology and ages of fluvial features found at confluences.},

  abstract = {Vocal duetting, where two birds produce temporally coordinated vocalizations, has been reported in a taxonomically and geographically diverse set of avian species. Researchers have suggested a number of potential correlates of duetting, including long term monogamy, year-round territory defense and sexual plumage monomorphism. Because the majority of duetting species are tropical, they have been the focus of the most comprehensive studies to date. There is, therefore, a real need for data regarding avian duets in temperate species. I used the recently completed Birds of North America species reports to examine the frequency, evolutionary origins and potential life history correlates of duetting behavior in North American passerines. "Duetting" behavior was reported in 7\% of species from 12 avian families, likely representing 17 separate evolutionary origins. Duetting species showed apparent long term monogamy and year-round territoriality at frequencies more than double those of non-duetting passerines: 65\% of duetting species were long term monogamous, compared to 27\% of non-duetting species, and 50\% of duetting species defended the same territory throughout the year, compared with only 11\% of non-duetting species. Duetting and non-duetting species showed statistically indistinguishable frequencies of sexual plumage monomorphism. Comparative analyses of duetting species and their sister taxa revealed that the shift to duetting is accompanied by a gain of long term monogamy and year-round territoriality more often than it is associated with a loss of those traits. This study provides intriguing summary evidence that selective factors promoting duetting may be associated with a sedentary, monogamous lifestyle, and may operate similarly across taxonomic groups. Furthermore, vocal duetting may be considerably more common among temperatezone species than previously recognized.}

To improve statistical inference about spatial covariance, we propose a continuous nonparametric estimator of the covariance function in place of the spatial correlogram. The spline correlogram is an adaptation of a recent development in spatial statistics and is a generalization of the commonly used correlogram. We propose a bootstrap algorithm to erect a confidence envelope around the entire covariance function. The meaning of this envelope is discussed. Not all functions that can be drawn inside the envelope are candidate covariance functions, as they may not be positive semidefinite. However, covariance functions that do not fit, are not supported by the data. A direct estimate of the L0 spatial correlation length with associated confidence interval is offered and its interpretation is discussed. The spline correlogram is found to have high precision when applied to synthetic data. For illustration, the method is applied to electrophoretic data of an alpine grass (Pou alpina).},

Actual spawning occurred over a period of \textasciitilde 50 d. Over 90\% of spawning males were present soon after spawning commenced and outnumbered females for the duration of the spawning period. The amount of time males and females remained on the spawning grounds increased with body size; however, males were present over a longer period than females of equivalent size. A distinct seasonal peak in spawning activity (\textasciitilde 15 d) accounted for 58 and 84\% (1994 and 1995) of all reproduction and was coincident with a decline in water temperature below 11\textdegree C and increased rainfall. Selection of redd sites by female brook trout was determined by groundwater flow which was significantly greater than at nonspawning sites. A preference for certain redd sites was observed, with 50\% of spawnings occurring at 11 sites. The construction of multiple redds and duration in spawning activity by females increased with body size. Extensive reuse of redd sites and rapid replacement of females during removal experiments indicate that redd sites are a limiting resource.},

The model describes a three level predator-preyresource system which oscillates with Uniform Phase evolution, yet has Chaotic Abundance levels or Amplitudes (UPCA). We investigate the phase synchronization of two nonidentical diffusively coupled phase coherent models (i.e. with UPCA dynamics) and extend the analysis to study the models' "funnel" regimes and response to noise forcing. Similar synchronization effects are reported for a two-dimensional lattice of chaotic population models coupled via nearest neighbors. With weak coupling, a collective phase synchronization emerges yet the peak population abundance levels are chaotic and largely uncorrelated. The synchronization patterns and traveling wave structures found in the spatial model correspond to those observed in natural systems - in particular, Ecology's well-known Canadian hare-lynx cycle. We show that phase synchronization has important applications in the study of ecological communities where the spatial coupling of populations can lead to large scale complex synchronization effects.}

Floods and droughts are projected to occur more frequently, but how aquatic species will respond to these extreme events remains uncertain. Based on counts of Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) collected over 28~yr at 115 sites in Shenandoah National Park, we developed mixed-effects models to (1) assess how well extreme streamflow, as compared to mean flows and total precipitation, can explain young-of-the-year (YOY) abundance, (2) identify potential nonlinear relationships between seasonal environmental covariates and abundance using nonlinear generalized additive mixed models, and (3) explore likely impacts of expected future weather and streamflow conditions. We found that (1) using covariates of streamflow extremes improved prediction of YOY abundance compared to use of mean seasonal flow values or precipitation as a proxy, (2) warmer maximum daily spring temperatures were associated with increased YOY abundance up to about 1.5 standard deviations, above which abundance declined, and (3) a strong negative effect of extreme winter streamflow, unlikely to be offset by possibly positive effects from other seasons, is expected to have a detrimental impact on Brook Trout populations given predicted increases in winter precipitation. Because YOY abundance is a strong determinant of population dynamics for these short-lived species, extreme events will have the potential to exert a strong influence on population persistence of Brook Trout in a changing climate. Management actions that maximize resiliency of populations in response to extreme events, such as restoration of habitat connectivity, should be prioritized to buffer negative impacts.},

Analysis of a test data set indicated that both the form of index and properties of the data set size can dictate the patterns of condition observed. The various indices were reviewed in terms of appropriateness, simplicity and statistical correctness. It was concluded that an index should be selected only after a detailed examination of both the underlying assumptions of the index and the properties of the data set.

A better understanding of the processes underlying synchrony is fundamental to predicting resilience loss in metapopulations subject to environmental change. The present study investigated the determinants of synchrony in density time series of three age groups of resident brown trout (Salmo trutta) (0+, 1+, and adults) in 36 stream reaches. A series of Mantel tests were implemented to disentangle the relative effects on trout synchrony of geographical proximity, environmental synchrony in key environmental variables affecting trout dynamics (discharge, water temperature, hydraulics, and spawning substrate mobility), and density-dependent dispersal. Results indicated that environmental synchrony strongly explained trout synchrony over distances less than 75 km. This effect was partly due to a negative influence on 0+ trout of strong discharges during the emergence period and a more complex influence of substrate mobility during the spawning period. Dispersal between reaches had a weak influence on results. Juvenile and adult densities were strongly driven by survival processes and were not influenced by environmental synchrony. The results suggest that the environment can have general effects on population dynamics that may influence the resilience of metapopulations.}

  abstract = {In fluvial systems, the interactions between rivers and groundwater significantly affect various ecological structures (for example, riparian vegetation) and functions. To examine the effects of hydrological exchange between groundwater and surface water on the distribution of aquatic invertebrates within a riverine landscape, we investigated the main stem, tributaries, and various surface and subsurface waters of two floodplains of a southern Alpine river (Brenno, Switzerland) in terms of their physicochemical, hydraulic, substratum, and faunal characteristics. The origins of the water were investigated by analyzing geomorphic settings and physicochemical variables. The two floodplains had different hydrological regimes. The middle floodplain was dominated by lateral inputs and exfiltration of hillslope groundwater from two different subcatchments. Bank filtration of river water sustained subsurface water only close to the channel. The aquatic habitats of the middle floodplain formed a rather homogeneous group with high taxon richness and intrahabitat diversities. These aquatic habitats resembled mountain springbrooks in their physicochemical characteristics and faunal compositions. In the lower floodplain, the exchange between river water and groundwater was more extensive. The aquatic floodplain habitats of the lower floodplain were fed mainly by deep and shallow alluvial groundwater, hyporheic exfiltration, and partly by surface water. In contrast to aquatic habitats of the middle floodplain, habitats of the lower floodplain showed a low intrahabitat and a high interhabitat diversity in terms of both substrate characteristics and faunal compositions. For both floodplains, ordination analyses showed a high concordance between the structure of the invertebrate community and the characteristics of the environmental habitat, including chemical, geomorphic, and hydraulic variables. Ordinations grouped aquatic habitats according to the origins of the waters. Taxon richness was related to local structural diversity, but species turnover was related to differential vertical and lateral connectivity. Exfiltration of groundwaters provided aquatic floodplain habitats for several specialized species. The results of this study show the significance of the river\textendash groundwater connectivity for the creation of the habitat mosaic that sustains biodiversity in floodplains and thus have important implications for managing the ecological integrity of floodplains.},

Higher quantiles (percentiles = 100\% \texttimes{} quantiles (0, 1)) of weight (W) at the same total length (TL) were indicative of better body condition in an allometric growth model that included separate slopes and intercepts for the before and after groups. All quantiles of walleye weights by TL increased in the years after alewife introduction, ranging from 1.01 to 1.12 times weights in the years before alewife introduction, with greatest increases for the lower ({$<$}0.50) quantiles and greater TLs. Quantiles up to 0.25 (the lowest 25th percentiles) of white bass weights were reduced in years after alewife introduction for TLs less than 300 mm, ranging from 0.78 to 0.98 times weights in the years before alewife introduction. However, quantiles greater than or equal to 0.50 (the upper 50th percentiles) of white bass weights increased for all TLs, ranging from 1.01 to 1.06 times the pre-1988 weights. A three-group analysis, which improved the model fit for longer white bass, indicated a reduction (0.80\textendash 1.0) in white bass body condition across all TLs in the first 2 years (1989\textendash 1990) after alewife introduction, whereas body condition actually improved (1.02\textendash 1.12) across all TLs in later years (1991\textendash 2004). Thus, after the establishment of alewives in 1988, walleye body condition improved for all fish at all lengths (the greatest improvement occurring among fish in poorer condition), whereas white bass body condition was initially reduced for all fish at all lengths for 2 years and improved in subsequent years. The approach that we developed for comparing fish body condition before and after a management action in Lake McConaughy could be applied to other weight\textendash length data sets typically evaluated with relative weight indices.},

We used three statistical approaches that varied in how they accounted for heterogeneity in allometric growth to estimate differences in body condition of blue suckers Cycleptus elongatus across 19 large-river locations in the central USA. Quantile regression of an expanded allometric growth model provided the most comprehensive estimates, including variation in exponents within and among locations (range = 2.88-4.24). Blue suckers from more-southerly locations had the largest exponents. Mixed-effects mean regression of a similar expanded allometric growth model allowed exponents to vary among locations (range = 3.03-3.60). Mean relative weights compared across selected intervals of total length (TL = 510-594 and 594-692 mm) in a multiplicative model involved the implicit assumption that allometric exponents within and among locations were similar to the exponent (3.46) for the standard weight equation. Proportionate differences in the quantiles of weight at length for adult blue suckers (TL = 510, 594, 644, and 692 mm) compared with their average across locations ranged from 1.08 to 1.30 for southern locations (Texas, Mississippi) and from 0.84 to 1.00 for northern locations (Montana, North Dakota); proportionate differences for mean weight ranged from 1.13 to 1.17 and from 0.87 to 0.95, respectively, and those for mean relative weight ranged from 1.10 to 1.18 and from 0.86 to 0.98, respectively.

For instance, cold-water fishes such as salmon can be adversely affected by maximum summer temperatures or by those exaggerated by land-use activities such as deforestation. The present study deals with the modelling of stream water temperatures using a stochastic approach to relate air and water temperatures in Catamaran Brook, a small stream in New Brunswick where long-term multidisciplinary habitat research is being carried out. The first step in the modelling approach was to establish the long-term annual component (pattern) in stream water temperatures. This was possible by fitting a Fourier series to stream water temperatures. The short-term residual temperatures (departure from the long-term annual component) were modelled using different air to water relations, namely a multiple regression analysis, a second-order Markov process, and a Box-Jenkins time-series model. The results indicated that it was possible to predict daily water temperatures for small streams using air temperatures and that the three models produced similar results in predicting stream temperatures. The root mean square error (RSME) varied between 0.59\textdegree C and 1.68\textdegree C on an annual basis from 1990 to 1995, with the warmest year (1994) showing the highest RMSE. Although 1992 was an exceptionally cold summer (coldest in 30 years), good predictions of stream water temperature were obtained, with an RMSE of approximately 1.24\textdegree C. Of the three models, the second-order Markov process was preferred based on its performance and its simplicity in development.Key words: small stream, water temperature, model, stochastic, root mean square error, Markov process.}

For instance, coldwater fishes such as the Atlantic salmon can be adversely affected by these maximum summer temperatures or by those exacerbated by land use practices such as deforestation. The present study deals with the modelling of maximum daily stream water temperatures using regression and stochastic models to relate air and water temperatures in Catamaran Brook, a small stream in New Brunswick where long-term multidisciplinary habitat research is being carried out. The regression model was a logistic type function while the stochastic model was based on the autocorrelation structure of the water temperature time series. The first step in the stochastic modelling was to establish the long-term annual component in stream water temperatures. This was possible by fitting a combination of a Fourier and Sine function to stream water temperatures. The short-term residual temperatures (departure from the long-term annual component) were modelled using a second order Markov process. Results showed that the regression type model was only possible on a weekly basis with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.93\textdegree C. Alternatively, the stochastic model showed that it was possible to predict maximum daily water temperatures for small streams using air temperatures only. The RMSE varied between 1.48 and 1.62\textdegree C on an annual basis from 1992 to 1997, which were lower than the regression model. Calibrations were carried out on a seasonal basis as well as during the summer of each year. However, the improvements in the modelling were less than 0.1\textdegree C. It was also noted that the empirical coefficient linking air to water temperatures residuals varied on a seasonal and summer basis, and this coefficient was related to summer discharge. Although variable, this empirical coefficient did not improve the modelling significantly on a seasonal or summer basis.},

The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Reproductive synchrony among gregarious mammals has a strong adaptive value and may lead to cooperative behaviors aimed at maximizing offspring survival. Additionally, temporal clustering of estrus has important implications on individual mating tactics and ultimately affects the degree of polygamy in a population. Although several studies have examined the reproductive biology of wild boar (Sus scrofa), much remains to be understood about the patterns of timing and synchrony of reproduction in natural populations. We analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of conception dates in an Italian wild boar population taking into account the effects of environmental and individual factors, in order to determine the main variables influencing the timing of reproduction and to detect the signs of a socially-driven reproductive synchrony. Specifically, for each litter belonging to 354 pregnant sows culled between 2006 and 2013 in a mountain area of Tuscany, we determined the conception date (CD) from an estimate of the mean fetal age and the culling date. We then investigated which factors drove the variation in CD, by implementing linear mixed models, Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses. The selected model showed significant effects of rainfall, temperatures, and previous and current productivity on CD, as well as a strong correlation of CDs among sows culled in close spatial and temporal proximity (i.e., in the same hunting ground and hunting season). Likewise, autocorrelation analyses and Mantel tests consistently indicated that closer sows had similar conception dates. Overall, our results confirm the effect of resource availability and climate on wild boar reproductive phenology, and suggest socially-driven reproductive patterns, in spite of a high turn-over in social groups due to hunting. Finally, possible advantages and evolutionary implications of reproductive synchrony in wild boar are discussed.},

The assumptions of the removal method are that changes in population size occur only through capture, and the probability of capture is equal for all individuals in a population during the removal sequence. A modification of the multinomial model is proposed and a new estimator developed. In the new model the likelihood density of the probability of capture is weighted with a beta prior. The case where {$\alpha$} = {$\beta$} = 1 (uniform prior) is compared with ML estimation and found to have lower bias and variance. The new method, unlike previous methods, does not fail for any catch vector thus avoiding the substitution of the total catch for the estimate of N when infinite estimates occur. The assumptions that result from applying large sample theory while estimating the variance of ML estimates are reviewed, and a condition presented for the inadequacy of asymptotic variance formulae when using the weighted estimator ({$\alpha$} = {$\beta$} = 1). Examples illustrating the use of the new method are given; one example illustrates the use of the new method when previous methods fail. Various assumption violations are investigated and the new method is found to be more robust against the violation of assumptions than previous methods.}

  abstract = {Spring-fed wetlands are ecologically important habitats in arid and semi-arid regions. Springs have been suggested as possible hydrologic refugia from droughts and climate change; however, springs that depend on recent precipitation or snowmelt for recharge may be vulnerable to warming and drought intensification. Springs that are expected to maintain their ecohydrologic function in a warmer, drier climate may be priorities for conservation and restoration. Identifying such springs is difficult because many springs lack hydrologic records of adequate temporal extent and resolution to assess their resilience to water cycle changes. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept for the assessment of certain spring types (i.e., helocrene, hypocrene, and hillslope springs) in terms of hydrologic and ecological resilience to climatic water stress using freely available remote-sensing and climate data. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1985 through 2011 to delineate surface-moisture zones (SMZs) associated with 39 clusters of 172 springs in a montane sage-steppe landscape in southeastern Oregon, USA. We developed and synthesized seven NDVI-based indicators of SMZ resilience to interannual changes in water availability: (1) mean and (2) standard deviation of July NDVI; (3) mean difference in July NDVI and (4) difference in coefficient of variation for July NDVI between each SMZ and its surrounding watershed; (5) response of SMZ July NDVI to 90-day antecedent precipitation; (6) response of SMZ July NDVI to the previous winter's snowpack; and (7) range of NDVI values from an exceptionally wet year followed by three dry years. Because all resilience indicators were highly inter-correlated, we derived an overall metric of SMZ resilience using principal components analysis that accounted for 66\% of total variance. This overall resilience score was positively correlated with SMZ elevation, slope, mean annual precipitation, and with the number of associated springs. Resilience was greater for SMZs on topographically shaded, north-facing slopes. Several high-resilience SMZs were located immediately below persistent snowbanks, suggesting a possible source of steady recharge throughout the growing season. The approach presented here\textemdash if combined with field assessments of spring hydrogeology, discharge, and groundwater age\textemdash could help identify spring-fed wetlands that are most likely to serve as hydrologic refugia from climate change.},

In 30 French stream reaches, using 5\textendash 8 samples (1 per year) each, we investigated whether the year-to-year seasonal hydrology influenced annual trout densities within reaches, and whether the relationships were shared by all reaches. We also searched for intraspecific interactions between and within cohorts. Trout data were age class (0+, 1+, and adults) densities. For each year, hydrology was described using 13 variables, each computed for a reproduction, emergence, and growth period related to the biological cycle of trout. We used analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) to test how trout densities at year n \textendash{} 1 and hydrology at year n influenced trout densities at year n. High flows during emergence significantly reduced the 0+ densities, consistently across the 30 reaches. Then, 1+ and adult densities were linked, respectively, to 0+ and 1+ densities from the previous year. Analyses also revealed density-dependent survival mechanisms for the 0+ cohort, suggesting intracohort competition. Therefore, hydrology constrains trout dynamics only during the critical emergence period, after which intracohort interactions regulate the 0+ density. Such mechanisms, validated across 30 environmentally different reaches, seem to be fundamental to trout population dynamics.},

Both large-scale autocorrelated climatic factors (the 'Moran effect') and dispersal between populations are candidates to explain synchrony, although their relative influence is difficult to assess. Only a few investigations have reported patterns of synchrony among freshwater populations, and even fewer directly related these patterns to an environmental variable. In the present study, we analysed the spatio-temporal patterns of fluctuation of 57 brown trout populations widespread across France, each sampled continuously during 5 years. We compared the respective influence of connectivity and stream distance within basins (i.e. that potentially allow a basin-scale dispersal) and environmental factors (hydrological and air temperature variables, available for 37 sites) on the synchrony of brown trout cohort densities (0 +, 1 + and adults). A series of Mantel tests revealed that the degree of synchrony was not related to connectivity or stream distance between sites, suggesting no effect of dispersal at the basin-scale. The degree of synchrony among sites for the 0 + fish was significantly related to the degree of hydrological synchrony (based on high flows during the emergence period). For all three age classes, the synchrony in the temperature patterns did not explain synchrony in trout dynamics. Our results allow us to discuss the respective influence of dispersal and climatic factors on the spatio-temporal patterns of trout dynamics at the basin scale.},

  abstract = {Stream temperature regimes are important determinants of the health of lotic ecosystems, and a proper understanding of the landscape factors affecting stream temperatures is needed for water managers to make informed decisions. We analyzed spatial patterns of thermal sensitivity (response of stream temperature to changes in air temperature) and maximum stream temperature for 74 stations in the Columbia River basin, to identify landscape factors affecting these two indices of stream temperature regimes. Thermal sensitivity (TS) is largely controlled by distance to the Pacific Coast, base flow index, and contributing area. Maximum stream temperature (Tmax) is mainly controlled by base flow index, percent forest land cover, and stream order. The analysis of four different spatial scales \textendash{} relative contributing area (RCA) scale, RCA buffered scale, 1km upstream RCA scale, and 1km upstream buffer scale \textendash{} yield different significant factors, with topographic factors such as slope becoming more important at the buffer scale analysis for TS. Geographically weighted regression (GWR), which takes into account spatial non-stationary processes, better predicts the spatial variations of TS and Tmax with higher R2 and lower residual values than ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. With different coefficient values over space, GWR models explain approximately up to 62\% of the variation in TS and Tmax. Percent forest land cover coefficients had both positive and negative values, suggesting that the relative importance of forest changes over space. Such spatially varying GWR coefficients are associated with land cover, hydroclimate, and topographic variables. OLS estimated regression residuals are positively autocorrelated over space at the RCA scale, while the GWR residuals exhibit no spatial autocorrelation at all scales. GWR models provide useful additional information on the spatial processes generating the variations of TS and Tmax, potentially serving as a useful tool for managing stream temperature across multiple scales.},

  abstract = {We investigated spatial patterns of synchrony among coral reef fish populations and environmental variables over an eight-year period on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by {$\leq$}100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100\textendash 300 km to 500\textendash 800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances {$\leq$}100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales ({$>$}800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance ({$\leq$}800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef.},

The model tracked individuals of both species through the daily processes of spawning, growth, feeding, mortality, and movement for 30 years in a stream reach consisting of connected pools, runs, and riffles. The southern Appalachian Plateau was divided into 101 watershed elevation band zones. Model simulations were performed for a representative stream reach of each stream order in each zone. Trout abundance was estimated by multiplying predicted trout densities (measured in number of trout per meter) by the total length of streams of each order in each watershed elevation zone. Three climate change scenarios were analyzed: temperature only (1.5-2.5C warmer stream temperatures); temperature and flow (warmer stream temperatures and lower baseline flows with threefold higher peak flows); and temperature, flow, and mortality episodes (warmer stream temperatures, changed flows, and flow-related scouring of redds). Increased temperature alone resulted in increased abundances of brook and rainbow trout. The temperature-and-flow scenario resulted in a complex mosaic of positive and negative changes in abundances in zones, but little change in total abundance. Addition of episodic mortality in the form of floods that scour redds and kill eggs and fry caused a net loss of rainbow trout. Predicted changes in habitat (based on simulation results and temperature alone) were, at best, weakly correlated with predicted changes in abundance.

  abstract = {Heterogeneity is a central feature of ecosystem resilience, but how this translates to socioeconomic resilience depends on people's ability to track shifting resources in space and time. Here, we quantify how climatic extremes have influenced how people (fishers) track economically valuable ecosystem services (fishing opportunities) across a range of spatial scales in rivers of the northern Rocky Mountains, USA, over the past three decades. Fishers opportunistically shifted from drought-sensitive to drought-resistant rivers during periods of low streamflows and warm temperatures. This adaptive behavior stabilized fishing pressure and expenditures by a factor of 2.6 at the scale of the regional fishery (i.e., portfolio effect). However, future warming is predicted to homogenize habitat options that enable adaptive behavior by fishers, putting \textasciitilde 30\% of current spending at risk across the region. Maintaining a diverse portfolio of fishing opportunities that enable people to exploit shifting resources provides an important resilience mechanism for mitigating the socioeconomic impacts of climate change on fisheries.           ,              Adaptive behavior stabilizes fisheries during drought.},

  abstract = {In the late nineteenth century, while advocates garnered support for a law protecting America's archaeological resources, the U.S. government was seeking to dispossess Native Americans of traditional lands and eradicate native languages and cultural practices. That the government should safeguard Indian heritage in one way while simultaneously enacting policies of cultural obliteration deserves close scrutiny and provides insight into the ways in which archaeology is drawn into complex sociopolitical developments. Focusing on the American Southwest, this article argues that the Antiquities Act was fundamentally linked to the process of incorporating Native Americans into the web of national politics and markets. Whereas government programs such as boarding schools and missions sought to integrate living indigenous communities, the Antiquities Act served to place the Native American past under the explicit control of the American government and its agents of science. This story of archaeology is vital, because it helps explain the contemporary environment in which debates continue about the ownership and management of heritage. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In most of these experiments interspecific competition was not distinguished from intraspecific competition. In the few studies in which the 2 were separated, interspecific competition was the stronger form in about a sixth of all experiments. When competition was demonstrated, intraspecific competition was as strong or stronger than interspecific in 3/4 of the experiments. Marine organisms showed consistently higher frequencies of competition than terrestrial ones as did large-sized organisms as compared to smaller ones. Plants, herbivores, and carnivores showed similar frequencies of competition in all habitats compared. The incidence of competition varied considerably from year to year and place to place. When both members of a pair were studied and some competition found, only one member was affected in well over half the experiments.-from AuthorDept of Biol Sci, Univ of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.

  abstract = {The abundance of lotic salmonids varies substantially through time, but the extent to which several sympatric species respond coherently to large-scale bioclimatic conditions has rarely been investigated for freshwater fishes. We compared correlations in salmonid density in central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8 of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O. mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from 1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the tractability of large systems to management control. However, causal mechanisms are hard to infer and require further research (e.g., the effects of ocean conditions). Our study provides a basis for such work.},

The magnitude of biochar's potential in this regard will depend on crop yield benefits, which have not been well-characterized across different soils and biochars. Using data from 84 studies, we employ meta-analytical, missing data, and semiparametric statistical methods to explain heterogeneity in crop yield responses across different soils, biochars, and agricultural management factors, and then estimate potential changes in yield across different soil environments globally. We find that soil cation exchange capacity and organic carbon were strong predictors of yield response, with low cation exchange and low carbon associated with positive response. We also find that yield response increases over time since initial application, compared to non-biochar controls. High reported soil clay content and low soil pH were weaker predictors of higher yield response. No biochar parameters in our dataset\textemdash biochar pH, percentage carbon content, or temperature of pyrolysis\textemdash were significant predictors of yield impacts. Projecting our fitted model onto a global soil database, we find the largest potential increases in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those characterizing much of the humid tropics. Richer soils characterizing much of the world's important agricultural areas appear to be less likely to benefit from biochar.},

Groundwater did not appear to influence the selection of individual redd sites within these discharge areas. Competition among females for the opportunity to spawn in a limited area defined by the discharging groundwater appeared to control the selection of redd sites. In southwestern Ontario streams, discharging groundwater was prominent throughout areas of spawning both at redds and at adjacent, nonspawning substrates ({$\leq$}7\hspace{0.6em}m). Consequently, relationships between groundwater and spawning site selection were ambiguous. On the unglaciated plateau of central Pennsylvania, no groundwater was observed in redds or nonspawning substrates in streams.

  abstract = {A surge of recent art has engaged ecology in newly complex ways, including by confronting environmental injustice and social violence in aesthetically provocative forms. Consider the visual culture abetting pipeline blockades and Indigenous sovereignty struggles, including at Standing Rock; the creative social engagements motoring the recent campaigns to remove arms and drug dealers and petrocapitalist climate deniers from the governing bodies of cultural institutions; and the social media feeds and direct actions driving recent Extinction Rebellion mobilizations. 1 Building off the insights of political ecology, my work addresses such practices by approaching ecology as a mode of intersectionality, insisting on the inseparability between environmental matters of concern and sociopolitical and economic frameworks of injustice. Intersectionality, emerging from a long history of African American activism and antiracist, antisexist politics, more recently codified in the Black feminist legal theory of Kimberl\'e Crenshaw, 2 and underscored within multiple struggles for decolonization, refuses to divide overlapping systems of oppression (such as those tied to race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability) and thereby challenges the essentialization of one or another term in isolation. Ecology, in my view, functions similarly as a site of indissoluble relationality that highlights, and indeed is constituted by, interaction (or even "intra-action," in the sense posited by Karen Barad, whose whose theorization within the field of feminist science studies rejects the separateness and purity of originary categories, arguing instead for a political ontology of being-in-relation 3). Just as carbon pollution materializes differential sociopolitical impacts-and there is indeed no way to account for toxicity outside of its disparate consequences-so too does economic inequality produce unequal vulnerabilities to environmental injustices. With the siloing of issues (for instance, with the tendency of eco-art to isolate and celebrate the nonhuman realm in an effort to escape anthropocentrism; or the exclusive focus on intra-human oppression in social justice art), we risk epistemic violence, which can translate into the extremes of privilege and exclusion in white environmentalism, green capitalism, and climate change denialism. Instead, in my view, the most compelling cultural work is that which explores and develops modes of ecology-as-intersectionality, wherein political ecology links with Indigenous and/or queer rights activism and/or movements against police brutality, media censorship, and capitalist extraction. In this vein, it is crucial to comprehend "naturecultures" (a term grammatically recognizing the refusal of binaries) as sites of complex and indivisible relationalities between and within the slippery category of the non/human, where humanity itself operates according to}

  abstract = {Brook trout at age 5 weighed from 65 to 1,751 g in 23 mountain lakes located in Banff, Jasper, and Waterton Lakes national parks in Alberta. Lake area ranged from 2.2 hectares to 2,065 hectares, maximum depths from 2 m to 96 m, and elevation from 1,019m to 2,347 m above sea level. For the 23 lakes, there were significant positive correlations between weight of age-5 fish and the natural logarithm of amphipod densities, the specific conductance of the waters, and the midsummer water tmeperature. There was a singificant negative correlation between fish weight and lake elevation. Analyses of brook trout stomach contents from 18 lakes indicated a cause-and-effect relationship between fish growth and amphipod abundance. A stepwise multiple regression analysis attributed 54\% of the lake-to-lake variation in brook trout growth to amphipod density, 11\% to maximaum depth, and 7\% to specific conductance. From regression anayses, several models were developed to predict the growth of brook trout. Test results indicatyed that the models are useful for predicting the potentials for slow, intermediate, or superior brook torut growth in mountain lakes of western Alberta}

In response to this exploitation, the age-frequency distribution shifted from old to younger fish, and the mean weight of all age-classes increased. Maximum weight of brook trout increased from 68 to 158 g (N = 40 and 134, respectively). Recruitment also increased; consequently, the population density and biomass remained at about 750 fish/hectare and 30 kg/ hectare. Thus, growth of brook trout increased when the density of the older cohort of fish was reduced, although the total density of the population did not change significantly.},

  abstract = {Few studies have quantitatively projected changes in demography in response to climate change, yet doing so can provide important insights into the processes that may lead to population declines and changes in species distributions. Using a long-term mark-recapture data set, we examined the influence of multiple direct and indirect effects of weather on adult and juvenile survival for a population of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in California. We found evidence for a positive, direct effect of winter temperature on adult survival, and a positive, indirect effect of prior rainy season precipitation on juvenile survival, which was consistent with an effect of precipitation on food availability during the breeding season. We used these relationships, and climate projections of significantly warmer and slightly drier winter weather by the year 2100, to project a significant increase in mean adult survival (12\textendash 17\%) and a slight decrease in mean juvenile survival (4\textendash 6\%) under the B1 and A2 climate change scenarios. Together with results from previous studies on seasonal fecundity and postfledging survival in this population, we integrated these results in a population model and projected increases in the population growth rate under both climate change scenarios. Our results underscore the importance of considering multiple, direct, and indirect effects of weather throughout the annual cycle, as well as differences in the responses of each life stage to climate change. Projecting demographic responses to climate change can identify not only how populations will be affected by climate change but also indicate the demographic process(es) and specific mechanisms that may be responsible. This information can, in turn, inform climate change adaptation plans, help prioritize future research, and identify where limited conservation resources will be most effectively and efficiently spent.},

Although applicable to all species for which collection records exist, initial development and refinement of FTDMS has focused on estimating the maximum weekly mean temperature tolerance for 30 common fishes of the United States. The method involves extensive use of automated data processing during data incorporation, quality assurance checks, data matching, and endpoint calculation. Maximum weekly mean temperatures derived from FTDMS were always less than laboratory-determined lethal temperatures and were similar to temperature criteria obtained from laboratory data through Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) interpolation procedures. The technique is a cost-effective means of generating temperature tolerance estimates for many U.S. fish species (i.e., more than 100).}

  abstract = {1. A short account is given of the occurrence of plague epidemics in wild mammals other than ``domestic'' rats and mice. Enough is now known to show that such epidemics are often of great practical importance.2. The method by which most rodents regulate their numbers is as follows: increase in numbers over several years up to a point at which an epidemic of some sort occurs, which kills off a large proportion of the population. Increase then takes place again, and is followed by another epidemic, and so on indefinitely.3. These periodic fluctuations are probably controlled by widespread climatic fluctuations, the best evidence for this being that in certain cases the former run synchronously in widely separated countries.4. There appears to be a dominant short period in fluctuation of three to four years, and a larger movement of period ten to eleven years, both in North America and Europe. The fact that the 11-year sunspot cycle roughly corresponds with the larger movement is significant.5. The data available from Eastern Asia suggest that there too, small mammals fluctuate periodically in numbers, and with similar periods to those of North America and Europe. There is also some evidence that the maxima of the 10\textendash 11-year fluctuations coincide in Eastern Asia and in North America, just as those of the 3\textendash 4-year period coincide in Northern Canada, Greenland and Norway.6. Evidence is given that the plague marmot (Arctomys bobac), and other rodents carrying plague, are liable to these fluctuations. If this proves to be true, it may be possible, when fuller data are available, to forecast with some accuracy the years of epidemics among these animals, and if this can be done we shall have some means of gauging the likelihood of the occurrence of plague outbreaks in the human population of those regions.7. The available data are admittedly fragmentary, but it is probable that between the years 1931 and 1934 epidemics among A. bobac in Transbaikalia and Mongolia will be severe, and that these events will lead to an increase of plague mortality in man.},

Monthly and weekly time scales were found to produce the best correlations. Streams affected by impoundments, reservoirs, and/or artificial heat inputs generally limit the air/stream interaction and produce poor correlations. Ground-water inflows, stream shading, and wind sheltering limit the influence of air temperature on stream temperature thereby reducing the slope of the relationship, but do not typically affect the strength of correlation. Air/stream temperature correlations from Minnesota remained linear throughout the extent of air temperatures experienced, whereas air/stream temperature correlations from Oklahoma departed from linearity as air temperatures exceeded approximately 25\textdegree C due to evaporative cooling. Linear air/stream temperature correlations will overestimate stream temperatures at extreme air temperatures.},

We used four criteria as indices of position quality: "water velocity difference" (the difference between velocity at the focal point and in the fastest current within 60 cm of the fish), water depth, distance to stream bed, and lighting. After brown trout removal, brook trout larger than 15 cm chose resting positions with more favorable water velocity characteristics and more often in shade. The position shift was greatest for the largest brook trout, those of 20\textendash 30 cm. Feeding positions of brook trout changed little upon brown trout removal according to our criteria. The shift in resting positions of brook trout after release from competition with brown trout indicates that brown trout excluded brook trout from preferred resting positions, a critical and scarce resource. The combined effects of such interspecific competition, differential susceptibility to angling, differential response to environmental factors, and predation of brown trout on juvenile brook trout may account for declines of brook trout populations while brown trout populations expand in many streams of the northeastern United States where the two species are sympatric.Key words: brook trout, brown trout, competition, ecological release, microhabitat use, resting positions, feeding positions, stream, Michigan},

  abstract = {Coexistence of species requires equalizing mechanisms that minimize fitness differences, which are balanced by stabilizing mechanisms that enhance negative intraspecific interactions versus interspecific ones. Here, we develop a simple theoretical framework that allows measuring the relative strength of intraspecific versus interspecific competition in dominance hierarchies. We use it to evaluate mechanisms promoting coexistence between two congeneric charr that compete for foraging positions, which strongly influence density-dependent growth and survival. Agonistic interactions (n~=~761) among 71 Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma and whitespotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis were measured by snorkelling in two pools in the sympatric zone of a Hokkaido stream during two summers. Interspecific dominance hierarchies, analysed using three methods, were closely correlated with fish length but the species treated each other equally. Ranks for the most dominant fish in each pool, determined directly by knockout experiments, were also virtually identical to ranks by length. Similarly, exponential random graph modelling of the social networks provided no evidence that either species was dominant over the other. Instead, larger fish were more likely to win contests, especially over fish of the next lower ranks. These results demonstrated that the two species were nearly ecological equivalents in accessing key resources in this sympatric zone. Nearly identical growth and stable densities over 4~years further supported this inference, although Dolly Varden were a minority (29\% of the assemblage), a sign of some fitness difference. Detailed foraging observations coupled with two concurrent studies revealed an effective stabilizing mechanism. Dolly Varden shifted to feeding directly from the benthos when drifting invertebrates declined, a behaviour enhanced by morphological character displacement, thereby partitioning food resources and enhancing intraspecific competition while avoiding agonistic encounters with whitespotted charr. The plurality of evidence indicates that fitness differences between these ecologically equivalent species are small in this local assemblage, and balanced by resource partitioning, a modest stabilizing mechanism that promotes coexistence.

Spatial dependence commonly occurs in ecological data and it is often argued that failure to account for spatial dependence can impact inferences in ecology and guidance for conservation. Here, we present the key concepts needed to understand why spatial dependence and related spatial autocorrelation occurs, estimate the degree of spatial dependence in data and potential spatial scale of the pattern, understand how the estimated spatial variance can be used to interpolate and simulate spatial patterns using kriging and related approaches, and identify the characteristic spatial scale(s) in the data using multiscale analysis. We illustrate these concepts with an example on Opuntia cactus and habitats in old fields. Our example shows how to estimate spatial dependence through the use of correlograms and semivariograms. It also shows how semivariogram modeling can be used for spatial interpolation via kriging and we contrast this to inverse distance weighting for interpolation. Finally, we show how multiscale analysis, such as wavelet analysis and Fourier transforms, can be implemented. We end by providing guidance on how ecologists can effectively diagnose spatial dependence in ecological data.},

This paper demonstrates that ground-level temperature regimes in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee and North Carolina) vary considerably over fine spatial scales and are only partially linked to synoptic weather patterns and environmental lapse rates. A 120-sensor network deployed across two watersheds in 2005\textendash 06 exhibited finescale ({$<$}1000-m extent) temperature differences of over 2\textdegree C for daily minima and over 4\textdegree C for daily maxima. Landscape controls over minimum temperatures were associated with finescale patterns of soil moisture content, and maximum temperatures were associated with finescale insolation differences caused by topographic exposure and vegetation cover. By linking the sensor array data to 10 regional weather stations and topographic variables describing site radiation load and moisture content, multilevel spatial models of 30-m resolution were constructed to map daily temperatures across the 2090-km2 park, validated with an independent 50-sensor network. Maps reveal that different landscape positions do not maintain relative differences in temperature regimes across seasons. Near-stream locations are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, and sites of low elevation more closely track synoptic weather patterns than do wetter high-elevation sites. This study suggests a strong interplay between near-ground heat and water balances and indicates that the influence of past and future shifts in regional temperatures on the park's biota may be buffered by soil moisture surfeits from high regional rainfall.},

In addition, hatchery-reared brook trout originating from northern populations have been widely stocked in the region's streams. To an undetermined extent northern brook trout have established themselves or interbred with the genetically distinct native Southern Appalachian strain. Genetic analyses have been performed on a portion of North Carolina's wild brook trout populations to identify those of unaltered native origin. However, information for many streams is lacking, and an assessment of the relative abundance or rarity of genetically unaltered native populations cannot yet be made. The objective of this project was to determine the phylogenctic origin of brook trout in 23 streams within the Pigeon River system, Haywood County, North Carolina. Fish were collected by electroshocking, and muscle tissue samples were obtained by nonlethal biopsy. The samples were analyzed by cellulose acetate gel protein electrophoresis for loci encoding creatine kinase and up to five additional enzymes. Allele frequencies for these enzymes indicated that 15 of the populations were of unaltered native Southern Appalachian origin, 2 were of hatchery-derived northern origin, and 6 were of mixed genetic origin. This information has been incorporated into a North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission trout species distribution database used in refining stream and fisheries management policies.},

  abstract = {There is substantial scientific and practical interest in the potential of riparian shading to mitigate climate change impacts on river temperature extremes. However, there is limited process-based evidence to determine the density and spatial extent of riparian tree planting required to obtain temperature targets under differing environmental conditions. A simulation experiment was used to understand the importance of riparian vegetation density, channel orientation and flow velocity for stream energy budgets and river temperature dynamics. Water temperature and meteorological observations were obtained in addition to hemispherical photographs along a \textasciitilde 1 km reach of the Girnock Burn, a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Nine hemispherical images (representing different uniform canopy density scenarios) were used to parameterise a deterministic net radiation model and simulate radiative fluxes. For each vegetation scenario, the effects of eight channel orientations were investigated by changing the position of north at 45\textdegree{} intervals in each hemispheric image. Simulated radiative fluxes and observed turbulent fluxes drove a high-resolution water temperature model for the reach. Simulations were performed under low and high water velocity scenarios. Both velocity scenarios yielded decreases in mean ({$\geq$} 1.7 \textdegree C) and maximum ({$\geq$} 3.0 \textdegree C) temperature as canopy density increased. Slow-flowing water resided longer within the reach, which enhanced heat accumulation and dissipation and drove higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures. Intermediate levels of shade produced highly variable energy flux and water temperature dynamics depending on the channel orientation and thus the time of day when the channel was shaded. We demonstrate that in many reaches relatively sparse but strategically located vegetation could produce substantial reductions in maximum temperature and suggest that these criteria are used to inform future river management.},

  abstract = {Synchronous variation in demographic parameters across species destabilizes populations, metapopulations and metacommunities and increases extinction risks. Revealing the processes that synchronize population dynamics across species allows to identify trans-specific demographic processes that are subject to environmental forcing of overarching importance. Using a Bayesian, hierarchical multi-site, multi-species mark\textendash recapture model, we investigated synchrony in annual adult local survival across 16 species of songbirds over France for the period 2001\textendash 2016, and the contributions of winter and spring weather conditions to synchrony. Adult annual survival was largely synchronous among species (73\% [47\textendash 94] of Species-by-Year variance), despite species differing in ecological niche and life-histories. This result was robust to differences in migratory strategy among species, uneven species sample sizes, and time de-trending. Shared synchrony across migratory strategy suggests that environmental forcing during the 4-month temperate breeding season has large-scale, cross-specific impacts among songbirds. At a scale \textasciitilde 1000 km a likely proximate mechanism of synchronization is forcing by weather-driven variation in resources, which, in particular, determines the cost of reproduction. However, the strong synchrony was not easily explained by climate, with spring weather variables explaining only about 1.4\% [0.01\textendash 5.5] of synchrony, while the contribution of large-scale winter weather indices may be stronger, but uncertain (12\% [0.3\textendash 37]). Future research should up-scale these results to community dynamics, to understand compensatory intra- and inter-specific demographic processes that preserve meta-communities from synchronization.},

  abstract = {Snowmelt-dominated basins in northern latitudes provide critical habitat for salmonids. As such, these systems may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of potential shifts in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of flows that can scour incubating embryos. A general framework is presented to examine this issue, using a series of physical models that link climate change, streamflow, and channel morphology to predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of streambed scour and consequent risk to salmonid embryos at basin scales. The approach is demonstrated for a mountain catchment in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Results show that risk of critical scour varies as a function of species and life history and is modulated by local variations in lithology and channel confinement. Embryos of smaller-bodied fall spawners may be at greater risk because of shallow egg burial depths and increased rain-on-snow events during their incubation period. Scour risk for all species is reduced when changes in channel morphology (width, depth, and grain size) keep pace with climate-driven changes in streamflow. Although climate change is predicted to increase scour magnitude, the frequency of scouring events relative to typical salmonid life cycles is relatively low, indicating that individual year classes may be impacted by critical scour, but extirpation of entire populations is not expected. Furthermore, refugia are predicted to occur in unconfined portions of the stream network, where scouring shear stresses are limited to bankfull stage because overbank flows spread across alluvial floodplains; conversely, confined valleys will likely exacerbate climate-driven changes in flow and scour. Our approach can be used to prioritize management strategies according to relative risk to different species or spatial distributions of risk and can be used to predict temporal shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. A critical unknown issue is whether biological adaptation can keep pace with rates of climate change and channel response. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Many new discoveries have been made with regard to their ecology and social behavior. The last twenty years has seen the commercialization of bumblebee breeding or pollination, and the invasion of new parts of the globe by bumblebee species, with potentially far-reaching consequences. Despite this, there is a great deal that we do not know about bumblebees. Their nests are hard to locate, so that those of some species have never been found. Fundamental aspects of the behavior of many species, such as mating, have never been seen. Bumblebees are undergoing a widespread decline, but his has not yet caught the attention of the general public to the same extent as, forexample, the plight of rare butterflies or birds. But bumblebees are probably of far greater ecological and economic importance than these groups because the pollination of crops and the survival of many wildflowers depend upon them. This book attempts to draw attention to the importance of conserving dwindling bumblebee populations. It synthesizes the current state of knowledgeof the behavior and ecology of these fascinating and charismatic organisms, and identifies some of the many gaps that remain in hope of stimulating further research},

The restricted movement paradigm (our term) hold that resident stream salmonids are sedentary. Numerous studies have supported the restricted movement paradigm, but nearly all have relied on the recapture of marked fish from the same areas in which they were released, an approach we believe is biased against detecting movement. We found substantial movement of trout in streams in Colorado and Wyoming using two-way weirs and radio telemetry. A review of the research on Lawrence Creek, Wisconsin, also showed that movement was important in the response of the trout population to habitat enhancement. Movement of resident stream fish has profound implications for research (e.g., measuring production and habitat models) and management (e.g., habitat enhancement, special regulations, and stocking hatchery fish). Methods capable of detecting fish movement could be incorporated into many studies to assess its importance in systems of interest. New theories and experiments are needed to understand the mechanisms that cause stream salmonids to move.},

  abstract = {We hypothesize that foraging stream salmonids move during summer because (1) they monitor habitat conditions at a reach scale (100s of m), and (2) dominant fish move when conditions in their present foraging location become sub-optimal relative to conditions at other locations in the reach. To test these ideas, we quantified temporal variation in foraging habitat quality between late spring and early fall in a reach of a small Rocky Mountain brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, stream, predicted optimal-foraging fish distributions within the reach, and experimentally manipulated access to foraging sites and measured fish responses. Our results show that high-quality foraging sites were located at certain places in the reach during one period, but at different places during others, consistent with the hypothesis that fish movement is required if dominant fish are to occupy high-quality foraging sites throughout summer. The optimal foraging model was able to predict foraging locations within study pools, but not the exact location of individual fish within the pools or the reach. However, empirical evidence suggests that fish were distributed in order to maximize energy intake at the reach scale. Finally, dominant fish excluded from their preferred foraging location either left the pools (three of six cases), or began to occupy focal points of the next largest fish which, in turn, exited the pool (two of six cases). If habitat selection was occurring only within habitat units, then large fish, when excluded from their preferred locations, would select the next best locations within the pool. Taken together, these results suggest that charr use summertime movements to both monitor habitat conditions at a large spatial scale, and to gain access to optimal foraging locations even as conditions change temporally.},

  abstract = {Spatial synchrony is the correlation between the temporal dynamics of local populations. This pattern may be driven by spatially correlated environmental variation (i.e., Moran effect), dispersal and trophic interactions. Investigating geographic patterns of synchrony can help disentangle the relative importance of these drivers. Using fish abundance data from long-term ecological research (17 years) in the Upper Paran\'a River floodplain, we studied the relative roles of dispersal distance, density dependence differences, and environmental synchrony in determining spatial synchrony of the most common species in this floodplain. We also investigated the geography of spatial synchrony by estimating modularity and site-level contributions to synchrony and anti-synchrony networks. We found positive spatial synchrony for most species, but levels were relatively low. For most species, our explanatory matrices were poorly related to spatial synchrony. We detected modular structures in some species networks, which reflected complex spatial patterns in synchrony. We also detected sites with high importance to spatial synchrony patterns that could be managed to increase metapopulation stability. The variable levels of spatial synchrony for fish species in the Upper Paran\'a River floodplain implies the need to monitor several sites to understand their dynamics in this region. Also, some migratory species of high importance to regional fisheries, such as Prochilodus lineatus, may deserve special monitoring attention due to the increased regional extinction risk associated with their high levels of spatial synchrony. Finally, we speculate that hydrological manipulation from upstream reservoirs should consider the timing of water releases to avoid spatially correlated population declines.},

In fact, many of the main ecological candidates for low-dimensional chaos are continuous-time host-parasite and predator-prey systems, driven by strong seasonal 'forcing' of one or more population parameters. This paper, therefore, explores the relation between seasonal forcing and metapopulation extinction for such systems. We base the analysis on extensive simulations of a stochastic metapopulation model for measles, based on a standard compartmental model, tracking the density of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals (the SEIR model). The results show that, by contrast with coupled logistic maps, the increased seasonality which causes chaos maintains or increases levels of global extinction of infection, by increasing the synchrony of sub-population epidemics. The model also illustrates that the population interaction (here between susceptible and infective hosts) has a significant effect on patterns of synchrony and extinction.},

Spatial correlation of fluctuations in different populations caused by synchronous environmental shocks2,7,8 is a powerful tool for quantifying the impact of environmental variations on population dynamics8,9. However, interpretation of synchrony is often complicated by migration between populations8,10. Here we address this issue by using time series from sheep populations on two islands in the St Kilda archipelago11,12,13. Fluctuations in the sizes of the two populations are remarkably synchronized over a 40-year period. A nonlinear time-series model shows that a high and frequent degree of environmental correlation is required to achieve this level of synchrony. The model indicates that if there were less environmental correlation, population dynamics would be much less synchronous than is observed. This is because of a threshold effect that is dependent on population size; the threshold magnifies random differences between populations. A refined model showsthat part of the required environmental synchronicity can be accounted for by large-scale weather variations. These results underline the importance of understanding the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on population dynamics14.},

  abstract = {1. We report patterns of temporal variation in the recruitment of roach (Rutilus rutilus). The data consist of the annual abundance of the first 2 year-classes, 0+ and 1+ fish, at four sites in the Rh\^one River (France) between 1987 and 1997. Over this 11-year period both 0+ and 1+ fish fluctuated strongly. 2. Cross-correlation indicated high spatial synchrony in 0+ dynamics, although correlations among sites in 1+ dynamics were weaker. No clear pattern was apparent in the relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between pairs of sites. 3. The spatial synchrony in 0+ fish could be attributable to large-scale variations in weather, influencing water temperature. Total body length of 0+ roach was correlated with water temperature (expressed in degree-days over 12 \textdegree C), and water temperature was the main factor explaining inter-annual variation in 0+ cohort size. Monthly variation in abiotic factors (measured by standard deviation in water temperature and discharge) did not influence 0+ fluctuations. Correlations with June water temperature suggest that year-class strength was mainly determined by abiotic factors during the first few months of life. 4. The absence of spatial synchrony in 1+ fluctuations suggests little correlation between survival and abiotic conditions during the first year of life, other factors influencing survival. 5. Survival in the first year was density-dependent. Intraspecific competition within the 0+ cohort could thus influence the fluctuations in recruitment to older age-classes. 6. The implications of age- or stage-dependent synchrony in temporal variation for species with complex life histories are discussed. Studying spatial synchrony for the different life history stages could enhance our understanding of the population dynamics of spatially structured species.},

  abstract = {The demography of vertebrate populations is governed in part by processes operating at large spatial scales that have synchronizing effects on demographic parameters over large geographic areas, and in part, by local processes that generate fluctuations that are independent across populations. We describe a statistical model for the analysis of individual monitoring data at the multi-population scale that allows us to (1) split up temporal variation in survival into two components that account for these two types of processes and (2) evaluate the role of environmental factors in generating these two components. We derive from this model an index of synchrony among populations in the pattern of temporal variation in survival, and we evaluate the extent to which environmental factors contribute to synchronize or desynchronize survival variation among populations. When applied to individual monitoring data from four colonies of the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica), 67\% of between-year variance in adult survival was accounted for by a global spatial-scale component, indicating substantial synchrony among colonies. Local sea surface temperature (SST) accounted for 40\% of the global spatial-scale component but also for an equally large fraction of the local-scale component. SST thus acted at the same time as both a synchronizing and a desynchronizing agent. Between-year variation in adult survival not explained by the effect of local SST was as synchronized as total between-year variation, suggesting that other unknown environmental factors acted as synchronizing agents. Our approach, which focuses on demographic mechanisms at the multi-population scale, ideally should be combined with investigations of population size time series in order to characterize thoroughly the processes that underlie patterns of multi-population dynamics and, ultimately, range dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We sampled a 100-m-long second-order site during both spring and autumn 1991\textendash 2004, using three-pass electrofishing. 2. Principle component analysis indicated that the site had lower average velocity, greater amounts of depositional substrata and lower amount of erosional substrata during the 1999\textendash 2002 drought than in non-drought years. In addition, drought years had lower flows, and lower variation in flows, than non-drought years. 3. Both young-of-the-year (YOY) and adult densities varied by an order of magnitude during the study. AIC analysis conducted on regressions of per capita rate of increase versus various population and habitat parameters for the population, adults and YOY, for both spring and autumn data sets, indicated that simple density dependence almost always was the only interpretable model with Akaike weights (wi) ranging from 0.262 to 0.836. 4. Growth analyses yielded more variable results, with simple density dependence being the only interpretable model for both adult spring data (wi = 0.999) and YOY autumn data (wi = 0.905), and positive density dependence (wi = 0.636) and simple density independence (wi = 0.241) representing interpretable models for spring YOY data. 5. We detected a significant stock\textendash recruitment relationship between both spring and autumn densities of adults in year t and autumn YOY density in year t + 1. Finally, spring YOY density was positively correlated with both autumn YOY density and spring mean YOY standard length (SL), suggesting that processes affecting recruitment show residual effects at least in the first year of life. This population appears to be regulated primarily by density-dependent processes, although high flows also negatively affected mean SLs of YOY.},

We also evaluated the potential impacts of global climate change (GCC) on this species and predicted how directional environmental changes will affect dace. We sampled two 30 m permanent sites in spring and autumn in the Coweeta catchment for rosyside dace density using three-pass electrofishing between 1984 and 1995, and a single 100 m site from 1991 to 2003. Habitat availability and flow variation data for this 20-year period demonstrated that two droughts (1985-1988 and 1999-2002) produced smaller wetted areas, lower mean, maximum and minimum flows, fewer high flow events and greater amounts of depositional substrata in the sites. Droughts produced significant increases in abundance, and significant decreases in standard length and mass of rosyside dace. Increases in abundance were mainly due to increased survival/immigration of young-of-the-year (YOY). Model selection analysis using multiple single and multivariable models indicated that density dependence in various forms possessed substantial explanatory power with respect to long-term variation in the per-capita rate of increase (r) in all sites and seasons. Density-dependent effects on r were stronger in autumn than spring, whereas negative density-independent models (flow variation) had the greatest explanatory power in spring. Results for growth data were similar to those for rosyside dace density and confirm density dependence likely through intraspecific competition for food or foraging sites leading to reduced growth at higher densities. These data support the hypothesis that species may persist in stochastic animal assemblages via strong intraspecific density dependence. Greater flow variability or increased high flows produced by GCC may destabilise this population leading to reduced compensation and possibly eventual extinction.},

We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40\% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years. /// Las sabanas de roble fueron hist\'oricamente comunes en el Medio Oeste de Estados Unidos pero actualmente son raras en esta regi\'on.

Cerca de un tercio de las especies no exhibieron relaciones estad\'isticamente significativas con ninguna de las combinaciones de siete caracter\'isticas de la vegetaci\'on, que incluyeron la cobertura de la vegetaci\'on en cinco estratos verticales, la densidad de \'arboles muertos y la altura de los \'arboles.

  abstract = {Warming rivers and an improved knowledge of thermal impacts on fish are fueling a need for simple tools to generate water temperature forecasts that aid in decision making for the management of aquatic resources. Although there is strong evidence for temperature-dependent mortality in freshwater fish populations, the application of water temperature models for in-season fisheries management is still limited due to a lack of appropriate temperature thresholds and due to uncertainty in forecasts. We evaluated the ability of statistical models based on seasonal trends, air temperature, and discharge to produce daily forecasts of water temperature in the Fraser River, British Columbia, including explicit quantification of uncertainty in predictor variables. For all models evaluated (with and without air temperature and/or discharge predictor variables), the top model choice varied as a function of environmental conditions, uncertainty in the air temperature forecasts used to predict water temperature, and the selection of quantitative performance criteria (i.e., defining the ``best'' model based on the smallest mean raw error or based on the ability to accurately forecast extreme water temperatures). Water temperature forecasts averaged across 10 d produced by simple models that were fitted only to historical seasonal water temperature trends were as accurate as forecasts generated from uncertain air temperature predictions. Models fitted to air temperature were critical for forecasting high temperature thresholds; even the use of uncertain air temperature forecasts predicted high water temperatures with greater accuracy than models that lacked an air temperature covariate. In contrast, models that were fitted to discharge variables lowered the rate of false-negative and false-positive errors associated with estimating below-average temperatures. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that fisheries managers should quantify the effect of uncertainties in model predictor variables when assessing water temperature models and should evaluate model performance in the context of system-specific conditions and management objectives.},

  abstract = {Environmental drivers, such as extreme weather events, impact population dynamics and can synchronize such dynamics across populations within a species. Given that many species depend on similar resources, such events might also be expected to synchronize dynamics across species, but the complexity of multispecies communities makes it difficult to reveal potential drivers in common. Hansen et al. (p. 313) took advantage of the simplicity of the year-round community on the high-arctic island of Spitsbergen to test for the presence of synchrony. Population fluctuations were synchronized across the three herbivore species (Svalbard reindeer, Svalbard rock ptarmigan, and sibling vole) and the single resident predator, the arctic fox, was in lagged synchrony. The driver of these fluctuations appears to be extreme winter rain-on-snow events that reduce the availability of winter forage due to ice cover. Reindeer, ptarmigan, vole, and fox populations on Svalbard respond together to extreme weather. Recently accumulated evidence has documented a climate impact on the demography and dynamics of single species, yet the impact at the community level is poorly understood. Here, we show that in Svalbard in the high Arctic, extreme weather events synchronize population fluctuations across an entire community of resident vertebrate herbivores and cause lagged correlations with the secondary consumer, the arctic fox. This synchronization is mainly driven by heavy rain on snow that encapsulates the vegetation in ice and blocks winter forage availability for herbivores. Thus, indirect and bottom-up climate forcing drives the population dynamics across all overwintering vertebrates. Icing is predicted to become more frequent in the circumpolar Arctic and may therefore strongly affect terrestrial ecosystem characteristics.},

  abstract = {The world is spatially autocorrelated. Both abiotic and biotic properties are more similar among neighboring than distant locations, and their temporal co-fluctuations also decrease with distance. P. A. P. Moran realized the ecological importance of such `spatial synchrony' when he predicted that isolated populations subject to identical log-linear density-dependent processes should have the same correlation in fluctuations of abundance as the correlation in environmental noise. The contribution from correlated weather to synchrony of populations has later been coined the `Moran effect'. Here, we investigate the potential role of the Moran effect in large-scale ecological outcomes of global warming. Although difficult to disentangle from dispersal and species interaction effects, there is compelling evidence from across taxa and ecosystems that spatial environmental synchrony causes population synchrony. Given this, and the accelerating number of studies reporting climate change effects on local population dynamics, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the implications of global warming for spatial population synchrony. However, a handful of studies of insects, birds, plants, mammals and marine plankton indicate decadal-scale changes in population synchrony due to trends in environmental synchrony. We combine a literature review with modeling to outline potential pathways for how global warming, through changes in the mean, variability and spatial autocorrelation of weather, can impact population synchrony over time. This is particularly likely under a `generalized Moran effect', i.e. when relaxing Moran's strict assumption of identical log-linear density-dependence, which is highly unrealistic in the wild. Furthermore, climate change can influence spatial population synchrony indirectly, through its effects on dispersal and species interactions. Because changes in population synchrony may cascade through food-webs, we argue that the (generalized) Moran effect is key to understanding and predicting impacts of global warming on large-scale ecological dynamics, with implications for extinctions, conservation and management.},

When the means and variances of the subpopulation extinction probabilities are both high (e.g. 0.25), temporal environmental correlation among populations may greatly reduce the average tim to metapopulation extinction, especially for large metapopulations. However, when the extinction rate and/ or its variance take on low to moderate values, even complete correlation in probabilities of extinction among populations may lead to relatively little diminuation in global persistence time.}

Bioenergetics models have emerged as useful tools for studying the ecology and management of fish species, but these models should be critically evaluated prior to widespread application. We conducted laboratory experiments to refine model parameters (metabolism and the activity multiplier) and to test a model for brook trout. Brook trout metabolic rates increased with temperature up to 20 degrees C, then declined sharply. Specific metabolism declined with increasing fish size. Validation experiments conducted for 7, 21, and 31 d at 12-16 degrees C showed that the model predicted consumption within 1.6 +/- 3.6\%, growth within 2.3 +/- 12.5\%, and final weight within 1.7 +/- 5.1\% of measured values. The results of this study will allow biologists to better use bioenergetics models to study the trophic dynamics of brook trout throughout their range.}

The motivations for investigations have changed little over the intervening period, being mainly the assessment of adult spawning biomass and distribution, and the desire to understand how environmental variations and changes in the abundance of other species interact to regulate the abundance in particular fish populations. In many cases, the annual recruitment of new juveniles into the population is the most important process governing population fluctuations. The factors affecting recruitment, particularly those affecting the survival of the eggs and larvae, are therefore perceived to be of key importance. In the review of the chapter, the progress of field research on the early life stages of marine fin fish is examined. The objectives of field studies are briefly stated in the chapter, followed by a review of sampling methodology, analytical techniques, and the methods for assessing adult spawning biomass from egg and larval abundance data. This chapter also discusses the field evidence for variability in the growth, survival, and behavior in relation to biological and physical oceanographic conditions concentrating on larvae but including eggs were relevant. Finally, the match-mismatch and member-vagrant hypotheses, and the role of density-dependence in early life stage regulation, are considered in the light of the field evidence. \textcopyright{} 1992, Academic Press Limited},

We observe a tight positive correlation between global extinction rate and the level of synchrony in dynamics among the subpopulations. Global disturbances and to a lesser extent, migration, are capable of synchronizing the temporal dynamics of the subpopulations over a rather wide span of the population growth rate r. Local noise decreases synchrony, as does increasing distance among the subpopulations. Synchrony also levels off with increasing r: in the chaotic region, subpopulations almost invariably behave asynchronously. We conclude that it is asynchrony that reduces the probability of global extinctions, not chaos as such: chaos is a special case only. The relationship between global extinction rate, synchronous dynamics and population growth rate is robust to changes in dispersal rates and ranges.},

Species ranges and ecological dynamics are already responding to recent climate shifts, and current reserves will not continue to support all species they were designed to protect. These problems are exacerbated by other global changes. Scholarly articles recommending measures to adapt conservation to climate change have proliferated over the last 22 years. We systematically reviewed this literature to explore what potential solutions it has identified and what consensus and direction it provides to cope with climate change. Several consistent recommendations emerge for action at diverse spatial scales, requiring leadership by diverse actors. Broadly, adaptation requires improved regional institutional coordination, expanded spatial and temporal perspective, incorporation of climate change scenarios into all planning and action, and greater effort to address multiple threats and global change drivers simultaneously in ways that are responsive to and inclusive of human communities. However, in the case of many recommendations the how, by whom, and under what conditions they can be implemented is not specified. We synthesize recommendations with respect to three likely conservation pathways: regional planning; site-scale management; and modification of existing conservation plans. We identify major gaps, including the need for (1) more specific, operational examples of adaptation principles that are consistent with unavoidable uncertainty about the future; (2) a practical adaptation planning process to guide selection and integration of recommendations into existing policies and programs; and (3) greater integration of social science into an endeavor that, although dominated by ecology, increasingly recommends extension beyond reserves and into human-occupied landscapes.},

Accounting for spatial population structure is important for sustainable management and harvest, but there is a need for a better understanding of the many mechanisms affecting the spatial structure of populations. In the large-scale research project SUSTAIN, detailed long-term data from several taxa within the boreal and Arctic ecosystems were used to address key research questions about spatial population structure. Here, we synthesise the main findings from these studies. Because nearby populations experience similar environmental variation, populations close to each other show more correlated dynamics than those at greater distances. However, several mechanisms can affect the extent of such spatial population synchrony, and we point to some similarities across systems that can explain the observed discrepancy between the spatial structure of the environment and that of population dynamics. We discuss the consequences of these findings for the practical management of species in a changing environment and the need for further research on how populations and ecosystems are affected by the spatial structure of the environment.}

This biocomplexity has enabled the aggregate of populations to sustain its productivity despite major changes in climatic conditions affecting the freshwater and marine environments during the last century. Different geographic and life history components that were minor producers during one climatic regime have dominated during others, emphasizing that the biocomplexity of fish stocks is critical for maintaining their resilience to environmental change.},

We evaluated effects of brown trout on brook trout behavior and habitat use in experimental streams across increasing temperatures (14\textendash 23 \textdegree C) with simulated groundwater upwelling zones providing thermal refugia (6\textendash 9 \textdegree C below ambient temperatures). Allopatric and sympatric trout populations increased their use of upwelling zones as ambient temperatures increased, demonstrating the importance of groundwater as thermal refugia in warming streams. Allopatric brook trout showed greater movement rates and more even spatial distributions within streams than sympatric brook trout, suggesting interference competition by brown trout for access to forage habitats located outside thermal refugia. Our results indicate that removal of introduced brown trout may facilitate native brook trout expansion and population viability in downstream reaches depending in part on the spatial configuration of groundwater upwelling zones.}

This region represents approximately 25\% of the species' entire native range and 70\% of the U.S. portion of the native range. This assessment resulted in an updated and detailed range map of historical and current brook trout distribution in the study area. Based on known and predicted brook trout status, each subwatershed was classified according to the percentage of historical brook trout habitat that still maintained self-sustaining populations. We identified 1,660 subwatersheds (31\%) in which over 50\% of brook trout habitat was intact; 1,859 subwatersheds (35\%) in which less than 50\% of brook trout habitat was intact; 1,482 subwatersheds (28\%) from which self-sustaining populations were extirpated; and 278 subwatersheds (5\%) where brook trout were absent but the explanation for the absence was unknown (i.e., either extirpation from or a lack of historical occurrence in those subwatersheds). A classification and regression tree using five core subwatershed metrics (percent total forest, sulfate and nitrate deposition, percent mixed forest in the water corridor, percent agriculture, and road density) was a useful predictor of brook trout distribution and status, producing an overall correct classification rate of 71\%. Among the intact subwatersheds, 94\% had forested lands encompassing over 68\% of the land base. Continued habitat loss from land use practices and the presence of naturalized exotic fishes threaten the remaining brook trout populations. The distribution of brook trout subwatershed status and related threshold metrics can be used for risk assessment and prioritization of conservation efforts. ?

Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

Using a 10-year data set and an information-theoretic approach, we tested a series of candidate models considering density-dependent and density-independent controls on brook trout population dynamics across a core-periphery distribution gradient within a central Appalachian watershed. We sampled seven sub-populations with study sites ranging in drainage area from 1.3-60 km2 and long-term average densities ranging from 0.335-0.006 trout/m. Modeled response variables included per capita population growth rate of young-of-the-year, adult, and total brook trout. We also quantified a stock-recruitment relationship for the headwater population and coefficients of variability in mean trout density for all sub-populations over time. Density-dependent regulation was prevalent throughout the study area regardless of stream size. However, density-independent temperature models carried substantial weight and likely reflect the effect of year-to-year variability in water temperature on trout dispersal between cold tributaries and warm main stems. Estimated adult carrying capacities decreased exponentially with increasing stream size from 0.24 trout/m in headwaters to 0.005 trout/m in the main stem. Finally, temporal variance in brook trout population size was lowest in the high-density headwater population, tended to peak in mid-sized streams and declined slightly in the largest streams with the lowest densities. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that local density-dependent processes have a strong control on brook trout dynamics across the entire distribution gradient. However, the mechanisms of regulation likely shift from competition for limited food and space in headwater streams to competition for thermal refugia in larger main stems. It also is likely that source-sink dynamics and dispersal from small headwater habitats may partially influence brook trout population dynamics in the main stem. \textcopyright{} 2014 Huntsman, Petty.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Temperature is an important variable structuring lotic biotas, but little is known about how montane landscapes function to determine stream temperatures. We developed an a priori hypothesis that was used to predict how watershed elements would interact to affect stream temperatures. The hypothesis was tested in a series of path analyses using temperature data from 26 sites on second-order to fourth-order streams across a fifth-order Rocky Mountain watershed. Based on the performance of the first hypothesis, two revised versions of the hypothesis were developed and tested that proved to be more accurate than the original hypothesis. The most plausible of the revised hypotheses accounted for 82 percent of the variation in maximum stream temperature, had a predicted data structure that did not deviate from the empirical data structure, and was the most parsimonious. The final working hypothesis suggested that stream temperature maxima were directly controlled by a large negative effect from mean basin elevation (direct effect = -0.57, p {$<$} 0.01) and smaller effects from riparian tree abundance (direct effect = -0.28, p = 0.03), and cattle density (direct effect = 0.24, p = 0.05). Watershed slope, valley constraint, and the abundance of grass across a watershed also affected temperature maxima, but these effects were indirect and mediated through cattle density and riparian trees. Three variables included in the a priori hypothesis - watershed aspect, stream width, and watershed size - had negligible effects on maximum stream temperatures and were omitted from the final working hypothesis.},

That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across {$>$}250 000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonids\textemdash bull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy ({$>$}0.9) were predicted to exist (33\textendash 68 BT refugia; 917\textendash 1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands ({$>$}90\%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas ({$<$}15\%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a `climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets. Importantly, the approach creates a framework to integrate data contributed by many individuals and resource agencies, and a process that strengthens the collaborative and social networks needed to preserve many cold-water fish populations through the 21st century.},

Spatial-stream-network models were fit to a subset of those data that described mean August water temperatures (AugTw) during 63,641 monitoring site-years to develop accurate temperature models (r2 = 0.91; RMSPE = 1.10\textdegree C; MAPE = 0.72\textdegree C), assess covariate effects, and make predictions at 1 km intervals to create summer climate scenarios. AugTw averaged 14.2\textdegree C (SD = 4.0\textdegree C) during the baseline period of 1993\textendash 2011 in 343,000 km of western perennial streams but trend reconstructions also indicated warming had occurred at the rate of 0.17\textdegree C/decade (SD = 0.067\textdegree C/decade) during the 40 year period of 1976\textendash 2015. Future scenarios suggest continued warming, although variation will occur within and among river networks due to differences in local climate forcing and stream responsiveness. NorWeST scenarios and data are available online in user-friendly digital formats and are widely used to coordinate monitoring efforts among agencies, for new research, and for conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Increased crop yield is a commonly reported benefit of adding biochar to soils. However, experimental results are variable and dependent on the experimental set-up, soil properties and conditions, while causative mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. A statistical meta-analysis was undertaken with the aim of evaluating the relationship between biochar and crop productivity (either yield or above-ground biomass). Results showed an overall small, but statistically significant, benefit of biochar application to soils on crop productivity, with a grand mean increase of 10\%. However, the mean results for each analysis performed within the meta-analysis covered a wide range (from -28\% to 39\%). The greatest (positive) effects with regard to soil analyses were seen in acidic (14\%) and neutral pH soils (13\%), and in soils with a coarse (10\%) or medium texture (13\%). This suggests that two of the main mechanisms for yield increase may be a liming effect and an improved water holding capacity of the soil, along with improved crop nutrient availability. The greatest positive result was seen in biochar applications at a rate of 100 t ha-1 (39\%). Of the biochar feedstocks considered and in relation to crop productivity, poultry litter showed the strongest (significant) positive effect (28\%), in contrast to biosolids, which were the only feedstock showing a statistically significant negative effect (-28\%). However, many auxiliary data sets (i.e. information concerning co-variables) are incomplete and the full range of relevant soil types, as well as environmental and management conditions are yet to be investigated. Furthermore, only short-term studies limited to periods of 1 to 2 years are currently available. This paper highlights the need for a strategic research effort, to allow elucidation of mechanisms, differentiated by environmental and management factors and to include studies over longer time frames.},

We used linear modeling techniques to partition likely effects of shallow groundwater seepage and air temperature on stream temperatures for 79 sites in nine focal watersheds using hourly air and water temperature measurements collected during summer months from 2012 to 2015 in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA. Shallow groundwater effects exhibited more variation within watersheds than between them, indicating the importance of reach-scale assessments and the limited capacity to extrapolate upstream groundwater influences from downstream measurements. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models revealed intricate interactions among geomorphological landform features (stream slope, elevation, network length, contributing area, and channel confinement) and seasonal precipitation patterns (winter, spring, and summer months) that together were robust predictors of spatial and temporal variation in groundwater influence on stream temperatures. The final BRT model performed well for training data and cross-validated samples (correlation = 0.984 and 0.760, respectively). Geomorphological and precipitation predictors of groundwater influence varied in their importance between watersheds, suggesting differences in spatial and temporal controls of recharge dynamics and the depth of the groundwater source. We demonstrate an application of the final BRT model to predict groundwater effects from landform and precipitation covariates at 1075 new sites distributed at 100 m increments within focal watersheds. Our study provides a framework to estimate effects of groundwater seepage on stream temperature in unsampled locations. We discuss applications for climate change research to account for groundwater-surface water interactions when projecting future thermal thresholds for stream biota.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of research into air and stream temperature dynamics, paired air-water annual temperature signals have been underutilized to characterize watershed processes. Annual stream temperature dynamics are useful in classifying fundamental thermal regimes and can enhance process-based interpretation of stream temperature controls, including deep and shallow groundwater discharge, when paired with air signals. In this study, we investigated multi-scale variability in annual paired air-water temperature patterns using sine-wave linear regressions of multi-year daily temperature data from streams of various sizes. A total of 311 sites from two spatially intensive regional datasets (Shenandoah National Park and Olympic Experimental State Forest) and a spatially extensive national dataset spanning the contiguous United States (U.S. Geological Survey gages) were evaluated. We calculated three annual air-water thermal metrics (mean ratio, phase lag, and amplitude ratio) to deduce the influence of groundwater and other watershed processes on stream thermal regimes at multiple spatial scales. Site-specific values of the three annual air-water thermal metrics ranged from 0.69 to 5.29 (mean ratio), -9 to 40 days (phase lag), and 0.29 to 1.12 (amplitude ratio). Regional patterns in the annual thermal metrics revealed persistent yet spatially variable influences of shallow groundwater discharge and high levels of thermal variability within watersheds, indicating the importance of local hydrogeological controls on stream temperature. Furthermore, annual thermal metric patterns from the regional datasets were generally concordant with the national dataset suggesting the utility of these annual thermal metrics for analysis at multiple scales. Analysis of the national dataset showed that previously defined thermal regimes based on water temperature alone could be further refined using air-water metrics and these metrics were related to physiographic watershed characteristics such as contributing area, elevation, and slope. This research demonstrates the importance of spatial scale and heterogeneity for inferring hydrological process in streams and provides guidance for the interpretation of annual air-water temperature metrics that can be efficiently applied to the growing database of multi-year temperature records. Results from this research can aid in the prediction of future thermal habitat suitability for coldwater-adapted species at ecologically and management-relevant spatial scales with readily available data.},

In the context of sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand and quantify exchange processes between groundwater and surface water. Numerous well-known methods exist for parameter estimation and process identification in aquifers and surface waters. Only in recent years has the transition zone become a subject of major research interest; thus, the need has evolved for appropriate methods applicable in this zone. This article provides an overview of the methods that are currently applied and described in the literature for estimating fluxes at the groundwater \&ndash; surface water interface. Considerations for choosing appropriate methods are given including spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties, and limitations in application. It is concluded that a multi-scale approach combining multiple measuring methods may considerably constrain estimates of fluxes between groundwater and surface water.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Even when such information exists, data are typically only available from intensive fieldwork (e.g., mark\textendash recapture studies) at a limited spatial extent. Here, we investigated effects of seasonal air temperature and precipitation (fall, winter, and spring) on survival and recruitment of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) at a broad spatial scale using a novel stage-structured population model. The data were a 15-year record of brook trout abundance from 72 sites distributed across a 170-km-long mountain range in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA. Population vital rates responded differently to weather and site-specific conditions. Specifically, young-of-year survival was most strongly affected by spring temperature, adult survival by elevation and per-capita recruitment by winter precipitation. Low fall precipitation and high winter precipitation, the latter of which is predicted to increase under climate change for the study region, had the strongest negative effects on trout populations. Simulations show that trout abundance could be greatly reduced under constant high winter precipitation, consistent with the expected effects of gravel-scouring flows on eggs and newly hatched individuals. However, high-elevation sites would be less vulnerable to local extinction because they supported higher adult survival. Furthermore, the majority of brook trout populations are projected to persist if high winter precipitation occurs only intermittently ({$\leq$}3 of 5 years) due to density-dependent recruitment. Variable drivers of vital rates should be commonly found in animal populations characterized by ontogenetic changes in habitat, and such stage-structured effects may increase population persistence to changing climate by not affecting all life stages simultaneously. Yet, our results also demonstrate that weather patterns during seemingly less consequential seasons (e.g., winter precipitation) can have major impacts on animal population dynamics.},

However, the relative influence of seasonal weather patterns on YOY abundance is poorly understood. We assessed the importance of seasonal air temperature (a surrogate for stream temperature) and precipitation (a surrogate for stream flow) on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) YOY summer abundance using a 29-year data set from 115 sites in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, U.S.A. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model that allowed the effect of seasonal weather covariates to vary among sites and accounted for imperfect detection of individuals. Summer YOY abundance was affected by preceding seasonal air temperature and precipitation, and these regional-scale drivers led to spatial synchrony in YOY abundance dynamics across the 170-km-long study area. Mean winter precipitation had the greatest effect on YOY abundance and the relationship was negative. Mean autumn precipitation, and winter and spring temperature had significantly positive effects on YOY abundance, and mean autumn temperature had a significant negative effect. In addition, the effect of summer precipitation differed along a latitudinal gradient, with YOY abundance at more northern sites being more responsive to inter-annual variation in summer precipitation. Strong YOY years resulted in high abundance of adults ({$>$}age 1 + fish) in the subsequent year at more than half of sites. However, higher adult abundance did not result in higher YOY abundance in the subsequent year at any of the study sites (i.e. no positive stock-recruitment relationship). Our results indicate that YOY abundance is a key driver of brook trout population dynamics that is mediated by seasonal weather patterns. A reliable assessment of climate change impacts on brook trout needs to account for how alternations in seasonal weather patterns impact YOY abundance and how such relationships may differ across the range of brook trout distribution.},

However, their responses to seasonal weather variation and global climate change are poorly known. The aim of this study was to compare effects of inter-annual variation in seasonal weather patterns on native brook trout (BKT) (Salvelinus fontinalis) versus invasive rainbow trout (RBT) (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance using summer electrofishing data (May through September) spanning 28~years in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S.A. (c.~200 stream sites per species). In particular, we tested if different spawning timing between BKT (autumn) and RBT (late winter) would result in heterogeneous population responses to high seasonal precipitation, which would negatively affect early life stages with impaired swimming ability. As predicted, young-of-the-year (YOY) abundance of autumn-spawning BKT was most strongly impacted by total precipitation between February and March, and RBT YOY abundance was most strongly impacted by peak precipitation between April and May. Despite the presence of these different key seasonal drivers, inter-annual variation in YOY density of these two species was positively correlated because precipitation in April and May also impacted the abundance of BKT YOY. Adult abundance was less responsive to weather variation than YOY abundance, and was most strongly correlated with YOY abundance in the previous year, indicating the importance of flow-driven population control influences on early life stages affecting population sizes into subsequent years. Adult BKT densities were not affected by any weather covariate, whereas adult RBT densities were correlated with four weather covariates in competing models. As a result, there was no correlation in the inter-annual variation in adult density in these two species. The differing responses of BKT and RBT to long-term seasonal weather patterns suggest that they will likely respond differently to global climate change. In particular, winter precipitation will likely be the key environmental driver of differences in their population responses.},

We characterized variation at 12 microsatellite loci in 22,020 Brook Trout among 836 populations from Georgia, USA, to Quebec, Canada, to the western Great Lakes region. Within-population diversity was typically lower in the southern Appalachian Mountains relative to the mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions. Effective population sizes in the southern Appalachians were often very small, with many estimates less than 30 individuals. The population genetics of Brook Trout in the southern Appalachians are far more complex than a conventionally held simple ``northern'' versus ``southern'' dichotomy would suggest. Contemporary population genetic variation was consistent with geographic expansion of Brook Trout from Mississippian, mid-Atlantic, and Acadian glacial refugia as well as differentiation among drainages within these broader clades. Genetic variation was pronounced among drainages (57.4\% of overall variation occurred among 10-digit hydrologic unit code [HUC10] units or larger units) but was considerable even at fine spatial scales (13\% of variation occurred among collections within HUC12 drainage units). Remarkably, 87.2\% of individuals were correctly assigned to their collection of origin. While comparisons with fish from existing major hatcheries showed impacts of stocking in some populations, genetic introgression did not overwhelm the signal of broad-scale patterns of population genetic structure. Although our results reveal deep genetic structure in Brook Trout over broad spatial extents, fine-scale population structuring is prevalent across the southern Appalachians. Our findings highlight the distinctiveness and vulnerability of many Brook Trout populations in the southern Appalachians and have important implications for wild Brook Trout management. To facilitate application of our findings by conservation practitioners, we provide an interactive online visualization tool to allow our results to be explored at management-relevant scales.},

To assess the sensitivity of stream temperature to change in a region where such a shift has the potential to occur, we examine the variability of and controls on the direct relationship between air and water temperature across the state of Pennsylvania. We characterized the relationship between air and stream temperature via linear and nonlinear regression for 57 sites across Pennsylvania at daily and weekly timescales. Model fit (r2) improved for 92\% (daily) and 65\% (weekly) of sites for nonlinear versus linear relationships. Fit for weekly versus daily regression analysis improved by 0\DH 08 for linear and 0\DH 06 for nonlinear regression relationships. To investigate the mechanisms controlling stream temperature sensitivity to environmental change, we define `thermal sensitivity' as the sensitivity of stream temperature of a given site to change in air temperature, quantified as the slope of the regression line between air and stream temperature. Air temperature accounted for 60\textendash 95\% of the daily variation in stream temperature for sites at or above a Strahler stream order (SO) of 3, with thermal sensitivities ranging from low (0\DH 02) to high (0\DH 93). The sensitivity of stream temperature to air temperature is primarily controlled by stream size (SO) and baseflow contribution. Together, SO and baseflow index explained 43\% of the variance in thermal sensitivity across the state, and 59\% within the Susquehanna River Basin. In small streams, baseflow contribution was the major determinant of thermal sensitivity, with increasing baseflow contributions resulting in decreasing sensitivity values. In large streams, thermal sensitivity increased with stream size, as a function of accumulated heat throughout the stream network. Copyright  2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Today, resource matching is restricted to a proximate role, and predator satiation is only one of many theories for the ultimate advantage of masting. Wind pollination, prediction of favourable years for seedling establishment, animal pollination, animal dispersal of fruits, high accessory costs of reproduction and large seed size have all been advanced as possible causes of masting. Of these, wind pollination, predator satiation and environmental prediction are important in a number of species, but the other theories have less support.

  abstract = {Many species exhibit widespread spatial synchrony in population fluctuations. This pattern is of great ecological interest and can be a source of concern when the species is rare or endangered. Both dispersal and spatial correlations in the environment have been implicated as possible causes of this pattern, but these two factors have rarely been studied in combination. We develop a spatially structured population model, simple enough to obtain analytic solutions for the population correlation, that incorporates both dispersal and environmental correlation. We ask whether these two synchronizing factors contribute additively to the total spatial population covariance. We find that there is always an interaction between these two factors and that this interaction is small only when one or both of the environmental correlation and the dispersal rate are small. The interaction is opposite in sign to the environmental correlation; so, in the normal case of positive environmental correlation across sites, the population synchrony will be lower than predicted by simply adding the effects of dispersal and environmental correlation. We also find that population synchrony declines as the strength of population regulation increases. These results indicate that dispersal and environmental correlation need to be considered in combination as explanations for observed patterns of population synchrony.},

Twenty-six streams in the Monongahela River basin of Pennsylvania were sampled over 200m standard reaches. Effort, as measured by the number of electrofishers employed, was increased as a function of increasing mean stream width ({$<$}30m) to a maximum of three operated abreast across the stream. We calculated proportional fish species richness (s\textasciicircum ) and the probability of detection (p\textasciicircum s1) for each species. Values of s\textasciicircum{} ranged from 1 to 27, whereas values of p\textasciicircum s1 ranged from 67 to 100 across all streams. Median p\textasciicircum s1 values did not differ significantly among effort categories nor did the probability of capturing a new species on pass two (P{$>$}0.05). Narrow 95\% confidence intervals around s\textasciicircum{} values attest to the validity of this approach in estimating species richness. Small percids (e.g., darters) and schooling (e.g., cyprinids) fishes evaded capture on the first pass more frequently than centrarchids, ictalurids, or catastomids. Our results indicate that increasing effort (as measured by number of electrofishing units employed incrementally over a standardized length of the sampling reach) provides a practical and efficient alternative to increasing sampling reach length with increasing stream width when sampling for species richness.},

We have detected synchrony in growth and reproduction, both within and among genera of Northern Hemisphere boreal trees, across geographical areas almost the size of a continent.

This discovery suggests that mast-seeding is an evolved strategy that occurs on a geographic scale far larger than previously suspected5.},

If environmental factors generally exhibit high levels of spatial autocorrelation, they may be playing a more important role in synchronizing animal populations than sometimes recognized. Here I examine this issue by analyzing spatial autocorrelation in annual rainfall and mean annual temperatures from sites throughout the world using the database maintained by the Global Historical Climatology Network. Both annual precipitation and mean annual temperatures exhibit high synchrony declining with distance and are statistically significant over large distance, often on a continental scale. In general, synchrony was slightly higher in annual precipitation at short distances, but greater in mean annual temperatures at long distances. No latitudinal gradient in synchrony of either variable was detected. The high overall synchrony observed in these environmental variables combined with a pattern of decline with distance similar to that observed in many animal populations suggest that the Moran effect can potentially play an important role in driving synchrony in a wide variety of ecological phenomena regardless of scale.},

So far, however, little attention has been given to temporal changes in spatial synchrony - the coincident change in abundance or value across the landscape - despite the importance of environmental synchrony as a driver of population trends and the central role of environmental variability in population rescue and extinction. Here we demonstrate that across North America, spatial synchrony of a significant proportion of 49 widespread North American wintering bird species has increased over the past 50 years - the period encompassing particularly intense anthropogenic effects in climate - paralleling significant increases in spatial synchrony of mean maximum air temperature. These results suggest the potential for increased spatial synchrony in environmental factors to be affecting a wide range of ecological phenomena. These effects are likely to vary, but for North American wildlife species, increased spatial synchrony driven by environmental factors may be the basis for a previously unrecognized threat to their long-term persistence in the form of more synchronized population dynamics reducing the potential for demographic rescue among interacting subpopulations.},

CRM1 in a Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutant showing extremely high resistance to LMB had a single amino acid replacement at Cys-529 with Ser. The mutant gene, named crm1-K1, conferred LMB resistance on wild-type S. pombe, and Crm1-K1 no longer bound biotinylated LMB. 1H NMR analysis showed that LMB bound N-acetyl-l-cysteine methyl ester through a Michael-type addition, consistent with the idea that LMB binds covalently via its {$\alpha$},{$\beta$}-unsaturated {$\delta$}-lactone to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-529. When HeLa cells were cultured with biotinylated LMB, the only cellular protein bound covalently was CRM1. Inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an alkylating agent, of CRM1-mediated nuclear export probably was caused by covalent binding of the electrophilic structure in NEM to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-529, because the crm1-K1 mutant showed the normal rate for the export of Rev nuclear export signal-bearing proteins in the presence of not only LMB but also NEM. These results show that the single cysteine residue determines LMB sensitivity and is selectively alkylated by LMB, leading to CRM1 inactivation.},

In the U.S., frequencies in the late 1800s/early 1900s were about as high as in the 1980s/1990s. This suggests that natural variability of the climate system could be the cause of the recent increase, although anthropogenic forcing due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations cannot be discounted as another cause. It is likely that anthropogenic forcing will eventually cause global increases in extreme precipitation, primarily because of probable increases in atmospheric water vapor content and destabilization of the atmosphere.

This study evaluated a statistical scheme to model average water temperature based on daily average air temperature and average discharge at the Sainte-Marguerite River, Northern Canada. The aim was to test a non-parametric water temperature generalized additive model (GAM) and to compare its performance to three previously developed approaches: the logistic, residuals regression and linear regression models. Due to its flexibility, the GAM was able to capture some of the nonlinear response between water temperature and the two explanatory variables (air temperature and flow). The shape of these effects was determined by the trends shown in the collected data. The four models were evaluated annually using a cross-validation technique. Three comparison criteria were calculated: the root mean square error (RMSE), the bias error and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSC). The goodness of fit of the four models was also compared graphically. The GAM was the best among the four models (RMSE = 1.44\textdegree C, bias = -0.04 and NSC = 0.94).},

  abstract = {1.Although recent decades have seen much development of statistical methods to estimate demographical parameters such as reproduction, and survival and migration probabilities, the focus is usually the estimation of parameters for individual species. This is despite the fact that several species may live in close proximity, sometimes competing for the same resources. There is therefore a great need for new methods that enable a better integration of demographical data, e.g. the study of synchrony between sympatric species, which are subject to common environmental stochasticity and potentially similar biotic interactions. 2.We propose a mark-recapture statistical model that uses random effect terms for studying synchrony in a demographical parameter at a multi-species level, adapting a framework initially developed to study multi-site synchrony to this novel situation. The model allows us to divide between-year variance in a demographical parameter into a 'synchronous' component, common to all species considered, and species-specific 'asynchronous' components, as well as to estimate the proportion of each component accounted for by environmental covariates. 3.We demonstrate the method with data from three colonially breeding auk species that share resources during the breeding season at the Isle of May, Scotland. Mark-resight information has been collected since 1984 for Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, common guillemots Uria aalge and razorbills Alca torda marked as breeding adults. We explore the relationship between synchrony in the species' survival and two environmental covariates. 4.Most of the between-year variation was synchronous to the three species, and the same environmental covariates acted simultaneously as synchronising and desynchronising agents of adult survival, possibly through different indirect causation paths. 5.Synthesis and applications. The model proposed allows the investigation of multi-species synchrony and asynchrony in adult survival, as well as the role of environmental covariates in generating them. It provides insight into whether sympatric species respond similarly or differently to changes in their environment, and helps to disentangle the sources of these differences. The estimated indices of synchrony/asynchrony can facilitate the generation of further hypotheses about similarities/differences in these species' ecology, such as the potential overlap of wintering areas. The method is readily applicable to other species, ecosystems and demographical parameters. \textcopyright{} 2010 British Ecological Society.},

The groundwater discharge along the river course was quantified for each identified groundwater catchment area using a heat budget based on temperature variations of the Loire River estimated from the TIR images. The results showed that 75 \% of the temperature differences, between in situ observations and TIR image-based estimations, remained within the {$\pm$}1 \textdegree C interval. The main discharge area of the Beauce aquifer into the Loire River was located between river kilometers 630 and 650, where there was a temperature drop of 1\textendash 1.5 \textdegree C in the summer and a rise of 0.5 \textdegree C in winter. According to the heat budgets, groundwater discharge was higher during the winter period (13.5 m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}) than during the summer period (5.3 m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}).

We tested three hypotheses on two separate brown trout populations inhabiting the southernmost basins of the Iberian Peninsula, with the aims of determining the relationships among (a) rainfall and air temperature for each season preceding fish sampling and the observed age group densities; (b) environmental synchrony and density synchrony for all possible pairs of sites; and (c) physical habitat similarity and the similarity of the density response to climatic drivers among pairs of sites. For this purpose, demographic series (98 surveys at 14 sampling sites), climatic conditions (rainfall and air temperature) and site habitat characteristics (physiogeographic and quality index values) were analysed between 2006 and 2014. The results show how the synchrony in the study populations is the result of a Moran effect directed mainly by winter precipitation and conditioned by the habitat similarity (highlighting the altitude, the distance to the upper limit and IHF index, along with the Euclidian distance among pairs of sites of the whole set of habitat variables). Preserving the heterogeneity of these habitat characteristics will increase the resilience of trout populations that inhabit this rear edge of distribution. The current context of global climate warming predicts extremely drastic changes in the dynamics of external drivers that regulate the trout populations in the study region.},

By combining theoretical simulations and an extensive fish population time-series dataset across Europe, we provide evidence that fish metapopula-tions can be buffered against synchronous dynamics as a direct consequence of network connectivity and branching complexity. Synchrony was higher between populations connected by direct water flow and decayed faster with distance over the Euclidean than the watercourse dimension. Likewise, synchrony decayed faster with distance in headwater than mainstem populations of the same basin. As network topology and flow directionality generate fundamental spatial patterns of synchrony in fish metapopulations, empirical synchrograms can aid knowledge advancement and inform conservation strategies in complex habitats.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since 1900, the distribution of native brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis has shrunk in the southern Appalachian Mountains area. Initial reductions were caused by logging and heavy fishing pressure but, in later years, encroachment by exotic rainbow trout Salma gairdneri may have contributed. Historical and current field evidence supports the hypothesis that the modern contraction of the brook trout's range is due to encroachment by rainbow trout. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee-North Carolina, brook trout formerly occurred from headwaters to low-gradient streams near the park boundary. They retain this longitudinal distribution in a few streams today, but only in those lacking rainbow trout. The typical pattern in other streams is for allopatric brook trout to be in upper stream reaches, allopatric rainbow trout in lower reaches, and a zone of sympatry (up to about 3.2 km long) between the two pure populations. Few age-0 rainbow trout occur in zones of sympatry unless adult brook trout are rare, and vice versa. In stream segments with similar physical characteristics, allopatric brook trout and allopatric rainbow trout have similar numerical densities, but the average size of rainbow trout is larger, and rainbow trout have biomasses about 1.8 times greater than that of brook trout. Adult allopatric brook trout occupy main channel habitats, but they occur predominately in peripheral stream areas when sympatric with rainbow trout. We believe the encroachment of rainbow trout is dynamic and continuing in the park and elsewhere in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and that brook trout ultimately will be reduced to a few small inbreeding populations in headwater refugia, and exterminated from many streams, if no management measures are taken.

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs. \textcopyright{} 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographical coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. -from Author}

  abstract = {Fragmentation can strongly influence population persistence and expression of life-history strategies in spatially-structured populations. In this study, we directly estimated size-specific dispersal, growth, and survival of stream-dwelling brook trout in a stream network with connected and naturally-isolated tributaries. We used multiple-generation, individual-based data to develop and parameterize a size-class and location-based population projection model, allowing us to test effects of fragmentation on population dynamics at local (i.e., subpopulation) and system-wide (i.e., metapopulation) scales, and to identify demographic rates which influence the persistence of isolated and fragmented populations. In the naturally-isolated tributary, persistence was associated with higher early juvenile survival (-45\% greater), shorter generation time (one-half) and strong selection against large body size compared to the open system, resulting in a stage-distribution skewed towards younger, smaller fish. Simulating barriers to upstream migration into two currently-connected tribuory populations caused rapid (2-6 generations) local extinction. These local extinctions in turn increased the likelihood of system-wide extinction, as tributaries could no longer function as population sources. Extinction could be prevented in the open system if sufficient immigrants from downstream areas were available, but the influx of individuals necessary to counteract fragmentation effects was high (7-46\% of the total population annually). In the absence of sufficient immigration, a demographic change (higher early survival characteristic of the isolated tributary) was also sufficient to rescue the population from fragmentation, suggesting that the observed differences in size distributions between the naturally-isolated and open system may reflect an evolutionary response to isolation. Combined with strong genetic divergence between the isolated tributary and open system, these results suggest that local adaptation can 'rescue' isolated populations, particularly in one-dimensional stream networks where both natural and anthropegenically-mediated isolation is common. However, whether rescue will occur before extinction depends critically on the race between adaptation and reduced survival in response to fragmentation.},

We explore the relative effects of these processes on the maintenance of wide observed body size variation in stream-dwelling brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Based on the analyses of multiple recaptures of individual fish, it appears that size distributions are largely determined by the maintenance of early size variation. We found no evidence for size-dependent compensatory growth (which would reduce size variation) and found no indication that size-dependent survival substantially influenced body size distributions. Depensatory growth (faster growth by larger individuals) reinforced early size variation, but was relatively strong only during the first sampling interval (age-0, fall). Maternal decisions on the timing and location of spawning could have a major influence on early, and as our results suggest, later ({$>$}age-0) size distributions. If this is the case, our estimates of heritability of body size (body length=0.25) will be dominated by processes that generate and maintain early size differences. As a result, evolutionary responses to environmental change that are mediated by body size may be largely expressed via changes in the timing and location of reproduction. Published 2011.

Currently, modelling efforts are limited by difficulties in establishing robust relationships between environmental drivers and population responses. We developed an integrated capture\textendash recapture state-space model to estimate the effects of two key environmental drivers (stream flow and temperature) on demographic rates (body growth, movement and survival) using a long-term (11 years), high-resolution (individually tagged, sampled seasonally) data set of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from four sites in a stream network. Our integrated model provides an effective context within which to estimate environmental driver effects because it takes full advantage of data by estimating (latent) state values for missing observations, because it propagates uncertainty among model components and because it accounts for the major demographic rates and interactions that contribute to annual survival. We found that stream flow and temperature had strong effects on brook trout demography. Some effects, such as reduction in survival associated with low stream flow and high temperature during the summer season, were consistent across sites and age classes, suggesting that they may serve as robust indicators of vulnerability to environmental change. Other survival effects varied across ages, sites and seasons, indicating that flow and temperature may not be the primary drivers of survival in those cases. Flow and temperature also affected body growth rates; these responses were consistent across sites but differed dramatically between age classes and seasons. Finally, we found that tributary and mainstem sites responded differently to variation in flow and temperature. Annual survival (combination of survival and body growth across seasons) was insensitive to body growth and was most sensitive to flow (positive) and temperature (negative) in the summer and fall. These observations, combined with our ability to estimate the occurrence, magnitude and direction of fish movement between these habitat types, indicated that heterogeneity in response may provide a mechanism providing potential resilience to environmental change. Given that the challenges we faced in our study are likely to be common to many intensive data sets, the integrated modelling approach could be generally applicable and useful.},

Freshwater fishes comprise until now almost 13,000 species (and 2,513 genera) (including only freshwater and strictly peripheral species), or about 15,000 if all species occurring from fresh to brackishwaters are included. Noteworthy is the fact that the estimated 13,000 strictly freshwater fish species live in lakes and rivers that cover only 1\% of the earth's surface, while the remaining 16,000 species live in salt water covering a full 70\%. While freshwater species belong to some 170 families (or 207 if peripheral species are also considered), the bulk of species occur in a relatively few groups: the Characiformes, Cypriniformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes, the Perciformes (noteably the family Cichlidae), and the Cyprinodontiformes. Biogeographically the distribution of strictly freshwater species and genera are, respectively 4,035 species (705 genera) in the Neotropical region, 2,938 (390 genera) in the Afrotropical, 2,345 (440 genera) in the Oriental, 1,844 (380 genera) in the Palaearctic, 1,411 (298 genera) in the Nearctic, and 261 (94 genera) in the Australian. For each continent, the main characteristics of the ichthyofauna are briefly outlined. At this continental scale, ichthyologists have also attempted to identify ichthyological ``provinces'' that are regions with a distinctive evolutionary history and hence more or less characteristic biota at the species level. Ichthyoregions are currently identified in each continent, except for Asia. An exceptionally high faunal diversity occurs in ancient lakes, where one of the most noteworthy features is the existence of radiations of species that apparently result from intralacustrine speciation. Numerous fish-species flocks have been identified in various ancient lakes that are exceptional natural sites for the study of speciation. The major threats to fish biodiversity are intense and have been relatively well documented: overexploitation, flow modification, destruction of habitats, invasion by exotic species, pollution including the worldwide phenomena of eutrophication and sedimentation, all of which are interacting.},

  abstract = {Recognition and analysis of spatial autocorrelation has defined a new paradigm in ecology. Attention to spatial pattern can lead to insights that would have been otherwise overlooked, while ignoring space may lead to false conclusions about ecological relationships. We used Gaussian spatial autoregressive models, fit with widely available software, to examine breeding habitat relationships for three common Neotropical migrant songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. In preliminary models that ignored space, the abundance of all three species was correlated with both local- and landscape-scale habitat variables. These models were then modified to account for broadscale spatial trend (via trend surface analysis) and fine-scale autocorrelation (via an autoregressive spatial covariance matrix). Residuals from ordinary least squares regression models were autocorrelated, indicating that the assumption of independent errors was violated. In contrast, residuals from autoregressive models showed little spatial pattern, suggesting that these models were appropriate. The magnitude of habitat effects tended to decrease, and the relative importance of different habitat variables shifted when we incorporated broadscale and then fine-scale space into the analysis. The degree to which habitat effects changed when space was added to the models was roughly correlated with the amount of spatial structure in the habitat variables. Spatial pattern in the residuals from ordinary least squares models may result from failure to include or adequately measure autocorrelated habitat variables. In addition, contagious processes, such as conspecific attraction, may generate spatial patterns in species abundance that cannot be explained by habitat models. For our study species, spatial patterns in the ordinary least squares residuals suggest that a scale of 500-1000 m would be appropriate for investigating possible contagious processes.},

Method: Existing data sources were used to model effects, in the urban setting in New Zealand, of varying the proportion of vehicle kilometres travelled by bicycle instead of light motor vehicle. Results: Shifting 5\% of vehicle kilometres to cycling would reduce vehicle travel by approximately 223 million kilometres each year, save about 22 million litres of fuel and reduce transport-related greenhouse emissions by 0.4\%. The health effects would include about 116 deaths avoided annually as a result of increased physical activity, six fewer deaths due to local air pollution from vehicle emissions, and an additional five cyclist fatalities from road crashes. In economic terms, including only fatalities and using the NZ Ministry of Transport Value of a Statistical Life, the health effects of a 5\% shift represent net savings of about \$200 million per year. Conclusion: The health benefits of moving from cars to bikes heavily outweigh the costs of injury from road crashes. Implications: Transport policies that encourage bicycle use will help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse emissions and improve public health. \textcopyright{} 2011 Public Health Association of Australia.},

We report here on assemblage-level autocorrelation in the benthic-invertebrate assemblages (retained in sieves of 300 \textmu m mesh) of riffles in two adjacent, relatively pristine rivers in southeastern Victoria, Australia (40-km reaches of the Wellington and Wonnangatta Rivers). These are related to patterns of autocorrelation in physical and catchment conditions (`environmental variables') in the vicinity of the sampling points. Both the invertebrate assemblages and environmental variables were autocorrelated at small scales (= 8 km) in the Wellington River in one of the sampling years (1996). Dissimilarities of invertebrate assemblages were correlated with dissimilarities of environmental variables in both sampling years (1996 and 1997) in that river. Environmental variables were autocorrelated in the Wonnangatta River, but this was not expressed as autocorrelation in the assemblages of invertebrates, which were not autocorrelated at any scale studied. Individual environmental variables showed different spatial patterns between the two rivers. These results suggest that individual rivers have their own idiosyncratic patterns and one cannot assume that even similar, geographically adjacent rivers will have the same patterns, which is a difficulty for ecological assessment and restoration.},

We have addressed this subject by examining the dynamics of a stream-resident population of Salmo trutta in a northwestern Spain stream. Recruitment was the major determinant of population size and the abundance of recruits resulted from a combination of regional and local environmental factors. Stream discharge in March determined the amount of stream area suitable for newly emerged trout (r2 = 0.59-0.79\%), that in turn determined the abundance of recruits at each site (r2 = 0.51-0.77\%). Stream discharge determines the overall strength of annual recruitment. Discharge, however, combines with stream morphology at the site scale to result in a site-specific area suitable for juveniles and, hence, site-specific recruitment. Thus, our study exemplifies how an environmentally driven animal population may persist on time with little or no operation of endogenous regulatory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {1. Several studies have offered evidence for the occurrence of density-dependent growth in stream-living Brown Trout. However, such evidence has been gleaned for low-density populations, whereas studies on persistently high-density populations have claimed that growth is density-independent. Such a paradoxical observation is shared with other salmonids and has been assumed by several authors to suggest that stream salmonid populations may be regulated by two different mechanisms: density-dependent growth at low densities and density-dependent mortality, in the absence of density-dependent growth, at high densities. 2. This comparative long-term study explored the occurrence of density-dependent growth by examining growth during the lifetime across cohorts in three stream-living Brown Trout populations representing the opposite extremes of growth and density documented throughout the species' distributional range. 3. This comparison highlighted identical growth-recruitment patterns in a high-density population with low potential for growth, in a low-density population with high potential for growth and in a population with intermediate traits. In the three populations, growth declined with increased recruitment describing negative power trajectories. These observations are consistent with there being a single, negative power relationship between growth and density where the effects of density dependence are stronger at low densities and become negligibly low at high densities. 4. Stream-living Brown Trout populations may be regulated by the continuous operation of density dependence on growth and mortality. In poorly recruited cohorts density dependence may operate on growth but not on mortality during a time period after which density dependence operates on both growth and mortality. In highly recruited cohorts, density dependence operates simultaneously on growth and mortality from the youngest life stages. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Author.},

The study was based on census data and environmental variables collected every fourth month over 1986-2006 at 12 sites selected along four Rio Esva tributaries (northwestern Spain). Density-dependent hypotheses involving the operation of current and lagged densities on recruitment and subsequent spawner density were analyzed at three increasingly larger geographical scales (site, stream, and river drainage). No evidence supported these hypotheses, suggesting an overall lack of negative feedbacks among year classes. Stream discharge in March when trout emerge and site depth explained substantial amounts of spatiotemporal variation in recruitment. The effects of these two factors on recruitment were sufficiently strong to be detected in year-class mortality and subsequent spawner density. Discharge and site depth determine the amount of spatial habitat suitable for sized individuals during their lifetime and, hence, the maximum number of individuals across space and time. Recruitment dependence, as a delayed density-dependent factor, adjusts the numbers in excess to the numbers established by spatial habitat. These findings differ markedly from the prediction of the most recent theories of population dynamics and are discussed in this context. \textcopyright{} 2007 NRC.},

Negative effects on survival and, hence abundance, of sugar maple seedlings could affect the relative dominance of species of canopy trees in these forests. Because there was no honeysuckle x deer interaction, control measures that target Amur honeysuckle and white-tailed deer separately could be employed without producing unintended effects on sugar maple seedlings.},

However, the likely energy implications of such a modal shift have remained relatively unexplored. In this paper we generate scenarios for increasing the cycling rate in Sheffield between 2010 and 2020. This is done through the novel application of a simple model, borrowed from population ecology. The analysis suggests that pro-cycling interventions result in energy savings through reduced consumption of fuel and cars, and energy costs through increased demand for food. The cumulative impact is a net reduction in primary energy consumption, the magnitude of which depends on a number of variables which are subject to uncertainty. Based on the evidence presented and analysed in this paper, we conclude that transport policy has a number of important energy implications, some of which remain unexplored. We therefore advocate the formation of closer links between energy policy and transport policy in academia and in practice; our approach provides a simple yet flexible framework for pursuing this aim in the context of modal shift.},

Simple linear regression models were used to described mean monthly water temperature as a function of mean monthly air temperature. There were no significant between-year differences within rivers, in the case of the Lambourn, Winterbourne and Tadnoll. For the Frome, only one year out of the eight studied was significantly different from the others. Further analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between the Tadnoll, Winterbourne and Lambourn, and that the relationship between maximum monthly water temperature and air temperature was best described by the equation y = 4.29 + 0.55x. Using this pooled equation to predict river temperatures for the three rivers studied gave mean deviations of less than 1 \textdegree C from the observed temperatures. It was concluded that linear regressions of the type presented are sufficiently accurate to predict the thermal regimes of rivers for a variety of limnological purposes. They can also be used to predict the temperature response of chalk streams to increased air temperatures that may be produced by climate change. The results predict that chalk streams would show less increase in temperature than other running waters under these circumstances.},

Consumer desires for large, powerful vehicles have been the major stumbling block in achieving a ``green car''. The other major barrier is inherent contradictions among social goals such as fuel economy, safety, low emissions of pollutants, and low emissions of greenhouse gases, which has led to conflicting regulations such as emissions regulations blocking sales of direct injection diesels in California, which would save fuel. In evaluating fuel/vehicle options with the potential to improve the greenness of cars [diesel (direct injection) and ethanol in internal combustion engines, battery-powered, gasoline hybrid electric, and hydrogen fuel cells], we find no option dominates the others on all dimensions.

In this study, annual and diel variability in stream water temperature was described at 135 unregulated, gauged streams across the USA. Based on magnitude, amplitude and timing characteristics of daily water temperature records ranging from 5 to 33 years, we classified thermal regimes into six distinct types. This classification underlined the importance of including characteristics of variability (amplitude and timing) in addition to aspects of magnitude to discriminate thermal regimes at the continental scale. We used a classification tree to predict thermal regime membership of the six classes and found that the annual mean and range in the long-term air temperature average along with spring flows were important variables defining the thermal regime types at the continental scale. This research provides a framework for a comprehensive characterization of the thermal regimes of streams that could provide a basis for future assessment of changes in water temperature caused by anthropogenic activities such as dams, land use changes and climate change.

  abstract = {Our objectives were (i) to assess the influence of fish density on the energy allocation pattern of juvenile brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and (ii) to define the mechanism by which this influence occurs. We estimated growth, consumption, and activity rates of brook trout held in 8-m3 enclosures characterized by two different densities (four or eight fish per enclosure; D4 and D8 enclosures, respectively). Eight experiments designed to estimate these variables were performed during a 27-day period. Fish from D4 enclosures ({$\Delta$}{\=W} = 0.46 g) grew twice as much as those from D8 enclosures ({$\Delta$}{\=W} = 0.24 g). For any given experiment, consumption rates were not significantly different between the two fish densities (0.434-1.09 g dry{$\cdot$}100 g wet-1-day-1). However, fish stocked in D8 enclosures displayed more aggressive behavior, executed 5.5 times more movements, and swam at speeds 13\% faster than fish in D4 enclosures. These differences resulted in activity rates fourfold higher in D8 enclosures than in D4 enclosures. Empirical analyses combining our results with published values of growth, consumption, and activity rates supported the hypothesis that competition can have a negative effect on growth through a decrease in consumption rates and an increase in activity costs.},

  abstract = {This is a regional study of the landscape, stream, and channel factors that control summer stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. The study focusses on two characteristics of stream temperature: the thermal regime, defined as the pattern of seasonal and spatial stream temperature variation in a stream, and the thermal sensitivity, considered here to be the slope of the stream\textendash air temperature relationship. The baseflow index, or degree of groundwater influence in a stream, is hypothesized to be an important regional control of both thermal regime and thermal sensitivity. Weekly stream temperatures were calculated and evaluated at 104 primarily unregulated sites that were geographically distributed across the region. Air temperature and streamflow explained an average of 94\% of the variance in annual thermal regimes and 68\% of the variance in August thermal regimes at individual sites. Regression results showed that thermal sensitivity to increasing air temperatures was less in summer than at other times of the year. Future climate projections of summer stream temperature, based on thermal sensitivities, are small in comparison to the range of summer stream temperatures that exist across the region. This observation highlights the need to understand summer thermal regimes as well as summer thermal sensitivities when assessing climate change impacts to regional stream temperatures. Multiple regression analysis identified several landscape factors and stream characteristics that explained summer stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities regionally. Two of the most important factors were baseflow index and stream channel slope. Lastly, the summer stream/air temperature ratio of a stream may be useful in assessing existing or expected stream temperature conditions at a site in relation to these factors or in identifying unique environmental conditions or potential restoration needs at a site.},

Although several studies have connected the use of bush honeysuckle as a nesting substrate to decreased nesting success, few have examined its potential effects on the growth or decline of songbird populations. From 2007-2009, we examined the nesting success of Field Sparrows (Spizella pusilla) in southwestern Pennsylvania old-fields to assess reproductive success based on nesting substrate and the density of Morrow's honeysuckle (Lonicera morrowii) surrounding the nest site. We used the information-theoretic approach to model nesting success as a response to nest substrate, cover of Morrow's honeysuckle, midpoint of nesting attempt, and clutch size. Our model indicated that Morrow's honeysuckle, as a substrate and when found in dense patches surrounding the nests of Field Sparrows, had a negative impact on nesting success. We developed a population model to determine if the measured reproductive success (17\% 6 5) could maintain a stable population. Results of the population model yielded 1.21 female offspring/adult female. This was not sufficient to maintain a stable population and resulted in a population sink. A sensitivity analysis indicated that adult survivorship was the most influential parameter in the population model, indicating that although breeding success was important, it was not the primary driver of population stability.},

We hypothesize that spatial heterogeneity, connectivity, and asynchrony among these patches regulate ecological dynamics of whole networks, altering system sensitivity, resistance, and resilience. Long-distance connections between patches may be particularly important in riverine macrosystems, shaping fundamental system properties. Furthermore, the type, extent, intensity, and spatial configuration of human activities (eg land-use change, dam construction) influence watershed-wide ecological properties through effects on habitat heterogeneity and connectivity at multiple scales. Thus, riverine macrosystems are coupled social\textendash ecological systems with feedbacks that influence system responses to environmental change and the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services.},

We have identified five specific topic areas of renewed research where new techniques and critical thought could benefit coldwater stream fishes (particularly salmonids): molecular, organism, population/species, community and ecosystem, and policy issues in water quality. Our hope is that information gained through examination of recent research fronts linking knowledge at various scales will prove useful in managing water quality at a basin level to protect fish populations and whole ecosystems. Standards of the past were based largely on incipient lethal and optimum growth rate temperatures for fish species, while future standards should consider all integrated thermal impacts to the organism and ecosystem.},

Predictions of their potential distribution and a better understanding of their relationship to habitat conditions would enhance the management and conservation of this valuable species. We used over 7,800 brook trout observations throughout New York State and georeferenced, multiscale landscape condition data to develop four regionally specific artificial neural network models to predict brook trout abundance in rivers and streams. Land cover data provided a general signature of human activity, but other habitat variables were resistant to anthropogenic changes (i.e., changing on a geological time scale). The resulting models predict the potential for any stream to support brook trout. The models were validated by holding 20\% of the data out as a test set and by comparison with additional field collections from a variety of habitat types. The models performed well, explaining more than 90\% of data variability. Errors were often associated with small spatial displacements of predicted values. When compared with the additional field collections (39 sites), 92\% of the predictions were off by only a single class from the field-observed abundances. Among ``least-disturbed'' field collection sites, all predictions were correct or off by a single abundance class, except for one where brown trout Salmo trutta were present. Other degrading factors were evident at most sites where brook trout were absent or less abundant than predicted. The most important habitat variables included landscape slope, stream and drainage network sizes, water temperature, and extent of forest cover. Predicted brook trout abundances were applied to all New York streams, providing a synoptic map of the distribution of brook trout habitat potential. These fish models set benchmarks of best potential for streams to support brook trout under broad-scale human influences and can assist with planning and identification of protection or rehabilitation sites. \textcopyright{} American Fisheries Society 2011.}

As these species distributions respond to rapid climate change, microrefugia may support local species persistence in the face of deteriorating climatic suitability. Recent focus on temperature as a determinant of microrefugia insufficiently accounts for the importance of hydrologic processes and changing water availability with changing climate. Where water scarcity is a major limitation now or under future climates, hydrologic microrefugia are likely to prove essential for species persistence, particularly for sessile species and plants. Zones of high relative water availability \textendash{} mesic microenvironments \textendash{} are generated by a wide array of hydrologic processes, and may be loosely coupled to climatic processes and therefore buffered from climate change. Here, we review the mechanisms that generate mesic microenvironments and their likely robustness in the face of climate change. We argue that mesic microenvironments will act as species-specific refugia only if the nature and space/time variability in water availability are compatible with the ecological requirements of a target species. We illustrate this argument with case studies drawn from California oak woodland ecosystems. We posit that identification of hydrologic refugia could form a cornerstone of climate-cognizant conservation strategies, but that this would require improved understanding of climate change effects on key hydrologic processes, including frequently cryptic processes such as groundwater flow.},

  abstract = {Determining adequate sampling effort for characterizing fish assemblage structure in nonwadeable rivers remains a critical issue in river biomonitoring. Two-pass boat electrofishing data collected from 500\textendash 1,000-m-long river reaches as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program were analyzed to assess the efficacy of single-pass boat electrofishing. True fish species richness was estimated by use of a two-pass removal model and nonparametric jackknife estimation for 157 sampled reaches across the United States. Compared with estimates made with a relatively unbiased nonparametric estimator, estimates of true species richness based on the removal model may be biased, particularly when true species richness is greater than 10. Based on jackknife estimation, the mean percent of estimated true species richness collected in the first electrofishing pass (pj,sj ) for all 157 reaches was 65.5\%. The effectiveness of single-pass boat electrofishing may be greatest when the expected species richness is relatively low ({$>$}10 species). The second pass produced additional species (1\textendash 13) in 89.2\% of sampled reaches. Of these additional species, centrarchids were collected in 50.3\% of reaches and cyprinids were collected in 45.9\% of reaches. Examination of relations between channel width ratio (reach length divided by wetted channel width) and pj,sj values provided no clear recommendation for sampling distances based on channel width ratios. Increasing sampling effort through an extension of the sampled reach distance can increase the percent species richness obtained from single-pass boat electrofishing. When single-pass boat electrofishing is used to characterize fish assemblage structure, determination of the sampling distance should take into account such factors as species richness and patchiness, the presence of species with relatively low probabilities of detection, and human alterations to the channel.},

The lower altitudinal margin of the southern part of the native range appears to be shaped by the 15\textdegree C groundwater isotherm. The climate warming scenario of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, GISS, was used to estimate the increase in groundwater temperature in the native brook trout range, and to estimate the increase in the altitude of the lower stream boundary in a warmer climate. The GISS scenario projects a 3.8\textdegree C increase in mean annual air temperature for the southern part of the native brook trout range in the next century, which leads to increases of up to 714 m in the altitude of the lower stream boundary, and to significant reductions in area available for brook trout. -from Author}

  abstract = {In the western United States, exotic brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis frequently have a deleterious effect on native salmonids, and biologists often attempt to remove brook trout from streams by means of electrofishing. Although the success of such projects typically is low, few studies have assessed the underlying mechanisms of failure, especially in terms of compensatory responses. A multiagency watershed advisory group (WAG) conducted a 3-year removal project to reduce brook trout and enhance native salmonids in 7.8 km of a southwestern Idaho stream. We evaluated the costs and success of their project in suppressing brook trout and looked for brook trout compensatory responses, such as decreased natural mortality, increased growth, increased fecundity at length, and earlier maturation. The total number of brook trout removed was 1,401 in 1998, 1,241 in 1999, and 890 in 2000; removal constituted an estimated 88\% of the total number of brook trout in the stream in 1999 and 79\% in 2000. Although abundance of age-1 and older brook trout declined slightly during and after the removals, abundance of age-0 brook trout increased 789\% in the entire stream 2 years after the removals ceased. Total annual survival rate for age-2 and older brook trout did not decrease during the removals, and the removals failed to produce an increase in the abundance of native redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri. Lack of a meaningful decline and unchanged total mortality for older brook trout during the removals suggest that a compensatory response occurred in the brook trout population via reduced natural mortality, which offset the removal of large numbers of brook trout. Although we applaud WAG personnel for their goal of enhancing native salmonids by suppressing brook trout via electrofishing removal, we conclude that their efforts were unsuccessful and suggest that similar future projects elsewhere over such large stream lengths would be costly, quixotic enterprises.},

We used long-term datasets (13\textendash 37 years) collected from 15 Missouri reservoirs to assess temporal trends and synchrony in sport fish recruitment by using catch per unit effort of age-1 (CPUE1) black bass Micropterus spp. during spring electrofishing (N/h) and CPUE1 of crappies Pomoxis spp. during fall trap-netting (N/net-night) as our index of recruitment. Although CPUE1 exhibited high interannual variation within a reservoir, time series analysis revealed only two significant trends for each of the black bass species, with all trends indicating increasing recruitment. White Crappie CPUE1 showed abrupt declines in all four reservoirs in the Osage River basin, with these declines occurring in different years in each reservoir. White Crappie CPUE1 in one northern reservoir and Black Crappie CPUE1 in all reservoirs appeared to be increasing over time. Within a species, some regional synchrony in CPUE1 occurred for Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, and Black Crappie but not for Spotted Bass. However, synchrony within a species was not universal and in some cases did not exist even among arms within large reservoirs. With few exceptions, there was little evidence for synchronous recruitment among species; those that occurred were among congeners. The lack of synchrony among black bass and crappie recruitment suggests that management practices designed to improve recruitment of one species may not enhance the recruitment of another species.

  abstract = {Identifying cross-scale patterns of ecological processes is imperative, especially in hierarchically structured riverine ecosystems. The role of abiotic factors in determining cross-scale spatial structure of stream fish populations and communities is well studied, but less is known about how species traits drive cross-scale patterns. We investigated the role of species traits for explaining autocorrelation of stream fish abundance at spatial scales ranging from local stream reaches to major basins. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) representing abundance autocorrelation within species (N = 47) at each of five spatial scales. A hierarchical Bayesian regression then modelled ICCs against spatial scale with the resulting regression coefficients modelled as functions of species traits. Finally, we ordinated the scale-by-species ICC matrix to calculate an overall metric describing species whose abundances were autocorrelated along a gradient of large to small scales, and modelled this metric as a function of species traits. Abundances of most species were autocorrelated at smaller spatial scales. Maximum fecundity had a significant positive relationship with abundance patterns across spatial scales. Species habitat affinities and body forms were significantly associated with overall abundance patterns across spatial scales: populations of upland/lotic-affiliated species adapted to streams with high flow correlated at small ({$\leq$}10 km2) spatial scales. Lowland/lacustrine species with laterally compressed bodies showed little correlation across scales. The appropriate spatial scale for modelling abundance is determined not only by exogenous (e.g. environmental) factors, but also endogenous factors, like traits. Careful consideration of traits and life history will aid researchers in designing more effective and efficient surveys and analyses.},

Sustainable Biochar (BC) from biomass and wastes can be an environmentally-friendly option for carbon sequestration, soil fertility improvement, pollution remediation and agricultural by-product/waste recycling. Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to bio fuels and other value-added products including biochar has attracted considerable attention since the mid-1970s due to petroleum price spikes, climate change and increasing energy demand [1]. Fast and slow pyrolyses are promising routes to renewable liquid fuels, biochars and chemicals. Fast pyrolysis is a promising route to recover renewable liquid fuels. Fast pyrolysis employs short residence time ({$<$}3 s) at 400-5000C in absence of oxygen to generate bio-oil or pyrolytic oil, bio-char and gas [1, 2].},

Linear regressions of stream temperature versus air temperature are attractive for this purpose, because they require only one input variable (air temperature) which can be simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs) better than other climate variables. Under a warmer climate scenario, high stream temperatures must be projected by extrapolation. The question arises whether linear extrapolation is valid. To answer the question, the heat exchange processes that contribute to surface water temperature have been analyzed and related to air temperature on a weekly time scale. The equilibrium temperature concept introduced by Edinger has been used. In stream reaches with large drainage area, stream temperature can be approximated by equilibrium temperature. At elevated air temperatures, the vapor pressure deficit above a water surface increases drastically (even in humid regions) causing strong evaporative cooling and hence a flatter stream temperature/air temperature relationship. At low air temperatures, stream temperatures often reach 0\textdegree C as an asymptote. If an upstream flow control (dam, reservoir release) or a waste heat input is present, the lower asymptotic value can be larger than 0\textdegree C. As a result of these upper and lower constraints for stream temperatures, the stream temperature/air temperature relationship resembles an S-shaped function rather than a straight line. Linear extrapolations to high and low air temperatures are therefore not justified.},

An error analysis indicated that only 39 stream gaging stations would not exhibit a significant change under the CCC-GCM 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate scenario. The projections at the remaining 764 stream gaging stations showed that mean annual stream temperatures in the contiguous United States would increase by 2\textdegree\textendash 5\textdegree C, least near the West Coast and most in the Missouri River and Ohio River basins. On average, there would be a 1\textdegree\textendash 3\textdegree C increase in the maximum and minimum weekly stream temperatures under the 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate scenario, most in the central United States.

One adaptation strategy is to focus conservation on climate-change refugia (that is, areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and sociocultural resources). In this Special Issue, recent methodological and conceptual advances in refugia science will be highlighted. Advances in this emerging subdiscipline are improving scientific understanding and conservation in the face of climate change by considering scale and ecosystem dynamics, and looking beyond climate exposure to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We propose considering refugia in the context of a multifaceted, long-term, network-based approach, as temporal and spatial gradients of ecological persistence that can act as ``slow lanes'' rather than areas of stasis. After years of discussion confined primarily to the scientific literature, researchers and resource managers are now working together to put refugia conservation into practice.},

Experimental mesocosms containing single species litter or a mixture of honeysuckle and one of two native tree species litter were established at South Farms and Trelease Woods study sites in Urbana, IL, and examined for their effect on 1) oviposition site selection by the three mosquito species, and 2) adult production and body size of Oc. triseriatus and Oc. japonicus. There were no significant effects of study site and leaf treatment on Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus oviposition preference and adult production. In contrast, significantly more Cx. restuans eggs rafts were collected at South Farms relative to Trelease Woods and in honeysuckle litter relative to native tree species litter. Significantly larger adult females of Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus were collected at South Farms relative to Trelease Woods and in honeysuckle litter relative to native tree species litter. Combining honeysuckle litter with native tree species litter had additive effects on Cx. restuans oviposition preference and Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus body size, with the exception of honeysuckle and northern red oak litter combination, which had antagonistic effects on Oc. triseriatus body size. We conclude that input of honeysuckle litter into container aquatic habitats may alter the life history traits of vector mosquito species.},

The scale for marine species is comparable with (but less than) that of the largest-scale environmental variables (and is compatible with the idea that large-scale environmental agents influence recruitment).

The goal of this study was to empirically estimate and compare fish assemblage production, production-to-biomass (P/B) ratios and species composition for 25 second- to third-order streams spanning the Appalachian Mountains (from Vermont to North Carolina) that vary in their temperature regimes. Fish assemblage production estimates ranged from 0.15 to 6.79 g m-2 year-1, and P/B ratios ranged from 0.20 to 1.07. There were no significant differences in mean assemblage production across northern cold-water, southern cold-water and southern cool-water streams (p =.35). Two warm-water streams, not included in these comparisons, had the highest mean production and biomass values. Mean assemblage P/B was significantly higher in northern cold-water streams relative to southern cold-water and cool-water streams (p =.01). Species evenness in production declined with stream temperature and differed significantly across the lower latitude cold-water, cool-water and warm-water streams and the higher latitude (i.e. more northern) cold-water streams. Our fish assemblage production estimates and P/B ratios were both lower and higher compared to previously published estimates for similar stream habitats. This study provides empirical fish assemblage production estimates to inform future research on southern Appalachian streams and on the potential impacts of varying temperature regimes on cold-water, cool-water and warm-water fish production in the coming decades as climate change continues to threaten fish assemblages.},

  abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of `variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

The fishes within a single pool in the stream formed an interspecific size-structured dominance hierarchy. Dominant individuals of both species maintained foraging territories against both subordinate conspecifics and heterospecifics, whereas subordinate charr adopted nonterritorial tactics. In each species, the most dominant fish usually held the focal point nearest to the pool inlet, which ensured priority of access to drifting food, with subordinates distributed farther downstream. Foraging microhabitats differed vertically in the water column between the species, charr utilizing a home range near the stream bed and salmon occupying the midlayer. The frequency of foraging attempts by salmon was considerably higher than that by char. Although daily body mass increments of dominant individuals were significantly larger than those of conspecific subordinates in each species, those of some subordinate salmon exceeded those of dominant charr. -Author},

  abstract = {Many migratory species are in decline across their geographical ranges. Single-population studies can provide important insights into drivers at a local scale, but effective conservation requires multi-population perspectives. This is challenging because relevant data are often hard to consolidate, and state-of-the-art analytical tools are typically tailored to specific datasets. We capitalized on a recent data harmonization initiative (SPI-Birds) and linked it to a generalized modelling framework to identify the demographic and environmental drivers of large-scale population decline in migratory pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding across Britain. We implemented a generalized integrated population model (IPM) to estimate age-specific vital rates, including their dependency on environmental conditions, and total and breeding population size of pied flycatchers using long-term (34\textendash 64 years) monitoring data from seven locations representative of the British breeding range. We then quantified the relative contributions of different vital rates and population structure to changes in short- and long-term population growth rate using transient life table response experiments (LTREs). Substantial covariation in population sizes across breeding locations suggested that change was the result of large-scale drivers. This was supported by LTRE analyses, which attributed past changes in short-term population growth rates and long-term population trends primarily to variation in annual survival and dispersal dynamics, which largely act during migration and/or nonbreeding season. Contributions of variation in local reproductive parameters were small in comparison, despite sensitivity to local temperature and rainfall within the breeding period. We show that both short- and long-term population changes of British breeding pied flycatchers are likely linked to factors acting during migration and in nonbreeding areas, where future research should be prioritized. We illustrate the potential of multi-population analyses for informing management at (inter)national scales and highlight the importance of data standardization, generalized and accessible analytical tools, and reproducible workflows to achieve them.},

  abstract = {1. The whole of this communication is essentially the summary of a much larger work, so it has been impossible here to do more than give an outline of its main features. 2. The densities of animal populations are known to bear a relation to the environmental conditions to which they are subject, and the existence of this relation shows that populations must be in a state of balance with their environments. 3. For balance, it is essential that the action of a controlling factor should be governed by the density of the population controlled, and competition seems to be the only factor that can be governed in this way. 4. Examination of the competition to which animals are subject shows that it is generally competition between animals when seeking the things they require for existence, or competition between natural enemies that hunt for them. 5. Detailed investigation of the question of competition between searching animals shows that, whether the animals are controlled by competition for food, or for suitable places in which to live, or by the competition of their natural enemies, there is for each species a particular density, referred to as the ``steady density,'' at which balance exists. The value of this steady density depends upon the properties of the species, the properties of the species with which it interacts, the nature of this interaction, and the properties of the environment. 6. Competition always tends to cause animals to reach, and to maintain, their steady densities. Factors, such as climate and most kinds of animal behaviour, whose action is uninfluenced by the densities of animals, cannot themselves determine population densities, but they may have an important influence on the values at which competition maintains these densities. 7. When the densities of animals are controlled by natural enemies, this interaction itself produces oscillation, even in a constant environment. With very simple types of interaction, such as that of a specific entomophagous parasite and its host, the oscillation of density increased in amplitude with time. 8. According to the circumstances, the final result of such oscillation is either the perpetual maintenance of the oscillation with constant amplitude under constant conditions, or the population is broken into widely separated small groups of individuals, the positions of which continually change with time. In the first situation the densities of the animals fluctuate about their steady values, but in the second the average densities are permanently maintained much below their steady values. 9. With more complex types of interaction the oscillation decreases in amplitude with time, so that in a constant environment the densities are caused eventually to reach, and to remain at, their steady values. 10. However, the environment does not remain constant, and it is found that periodic environmental changes, such as those of the seasons, tend to impress their period upon interspecific oscillation. Consequently the oscillation that is produced by the interaction of animals should generally be found to correspond in time with seasonal and other periodic environmental changes, but its violence is greater than that of the oscillation which these environmental changes could themselves produce. 11. Also, environmental oscillation applies an external force which prevents interspecific oscillation of the decreasing type from dying out. Irregular environmental fluctuations tend to cause corresponding irregular fluctuations in the densities of animals, but, owing to the delayed effects produced by interspecific oscillation, further irregularities in the densities of animals are subsequently produced that have no evident relation to environmental conditions.}

  abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme ( https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-cadastre/ ). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling ``best available'' data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3\_0Combined\_Federal\_Data\_References) facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory. This PAD-US Version 3.0 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous Version 2.1 dataset (USGS, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT ), achieving goals to: 1) Annually update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for PAD-US applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and PAD-US Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase PAD-US update efficiency. The following list summarizes the integration of "best available" spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in the PAD-US (other data were transferred from PAD-US 2.1). Federal updates - The USGS remains committed to updating federal fee owned lands data and major designation changes in annual PAD-US updates, where authoritative data provided directly by managing agencies are available or alternative data sources are recommended. The following is a list of updates or revisions associated with the federal estate: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations where available), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/ ). 2) Improved the representation (boundaries and attributes) of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, in collaboration with agency data-stewards, in response to feedback from the PAD-US Team and stakeholders. 3) Added a Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3\_0Combined\_Federal\_Data\_References) to the PAD-US 3.0 geodatabase to facilitate the extraction (by Data Provider, Dataset Name, and/or Aggregator Source) of authoritative data provided directly (or recommended) by federal managing agencies from the full PAD-US inventory. A summary of the number of records (Frequency) and calculated GIS Acres (vs Documented Acres) associated with features provided by each Aggregator Source is included; however, the number of records may vary from source data as the "State Name" standard is applied to national files. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the table and geodatabase describe the data type to highlight overlapping features in the full inventory (e.g. Designation features often overlap Fee features) and to assist users in building queries for applications as needed. 4) Scripted the translation of the Department of Defense, Census Bureau, and Natural Resource Conservation Service source data into the PAD-US format to increase update efficiency. 5) Revised conservation measures (GAP Status Code, IUCN Category) to more accurately represent protected and conserved areas. For example, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Production Area Wetland Easements changed from GAP Status Code 2 to 4 as spatial data currently represents the complete parcel (about 10.54 million acres primarily in North Dakota and South Dakota). Only aliquot parts of these parcels are documented under wetland easement (1.64 million acres). These acreages are provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are referenced in the PAD-US geodatabase Easement feature class 'Comments' field. State updates - The USGS is committed to building capacity in the state data-steward network and the PAD-US Team to increase the frequency of state land updates, as resources allow. The USGS supported efforts to significantly increase state inventory completeness with the integration of local parks data in the PAD-US 2.1, and developed a state-to-PAD-US data translation script during PAD-US 3.0 development to pilot in future updates. Additional efforts are in progress to support the technical and organizational strategies needed to increase the frequency of state updates. The PAD-US 3.0 included major updates to the following three states: 1) California - added or updated state, regional, local, and nonprofit lands data from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), managed by GreenInfo Network, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review coordinated by the data-steward with state managing agencies. Developed a data translation Python script (see Process Step 2 Source Data Documentation) in collaboration with the data-steward to increase the accuracy and efficiency of future PAD-US updates from CPAD. 2) Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data (and removed legacy data) from the Virginia Conservation Lands Database, provided by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Natural Heritage Program, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review by the data-steward. 3) West Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data provided by the West Virginia University, GIS Technical Center.

Yet few empirical studies have focused on testing hypotheses about the drivers of ecological temporal variability at large spatial and temporal scales. Using decadal datasets that span aquatic and terrestrial macrosystems and structural equation modeling, we show that local temporal variability and spatial synchrony increase temporal variability for entire macrosystems. These mechanisms are influenced by environmental heterogeneity, habitat-level species diversity, spatial scale, and the size of the regional species pool. This analysis is among the first to provide a quantitative argument for the value of regional species diversity. Moreover, our conceptual model is generalizable and may help guide management efforts to reduce temporal variability for conservation or service provisioning in other macrosystems.},

  abstract = {Spatial synchrony, that is, correlated population fluctuation over wide geographical areas, has been detected in diverse taxa and over various geographical scales. The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain spatial synchrony include dispersal and regional stochasticity (i.e., ``the Moran effect''). We analyzed landscape-scale historical outbreak data for six forest insect species: spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), western spruce budworm (C. occidentalis), larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on the relative importance of dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast, the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore, the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general, however, the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables, breaking with the predictions of Moran's theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such variation violates one of the assumptions of the Moran's theorem, namely, that the dynamic properties of disjunct populations are identical. We used a simple theoretical model to demonstrate that such geographical variation in local population dynamics may indeed force synchrony to decline more rapidly with distance than the correlation in the environment.},

  abstract = {In temperate and arid climate zones many streams and rivers flow intermittently, seasonally contracting to a sequence of isolated pools or waterholes over the dry period, before reconnecting in the wetter parts of the year. This seasonal drying process is central to our understanding of the population dynamics of aquatic organisms such as fish and invertebrates in these systems. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on the temporal dynamics of such populations. We describe a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) of fish population dynamics in such systems, which we use to explore the long-term population viability of the carp gudgeon Hypseleotris spp. in a lowland stream in southeastern Australia. We explicitly consider the impacts of interannual variability in stream flow, for example, due to drought, on habitat availability and hence population persistence. Our results support observations that these populations are naturally highly variable, with simulated fish population sizes typically varying over four orders of magnitude within a 50-year simulation run. The most sensitive parameters in the model relate to the amount of water (habitat) in the system: annual rainfall, seepage loss from the pools, and the carrying capacity (number of individuals per cubic meter) of the pools as they dry down. It seems likely that temporal source\textendash sink dynamics allow the fish populations to persist in these systems, with good years (high rainfall and brief cease-to-flow [CTF] periods) buffering against periods of drought. In dry years during which the stream may contract to very low numbers of pools, each of these persistent pools becomes crucial for the persistence of the population in the system. Climate change projections for this area suggest decreases in rainfall and increased incidence of drought; under these environmental conditions the long-term persistence of these fish populations is uncertain.},

  abstract = {Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the inland western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival, emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c. pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 m segments of four small mountain streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation, age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed. At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates, whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation. Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison, brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate the threat to native cutthroat trout, but selective removal regimes that capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be required.},

Freshwater ecologists have explored spatial patterns in stream networks using hydrologic distance measures and new geostatistical methodologies have recently been developed that enable directional hydrologic distance measures to be considered. The purpose of this study was to quantify patterns of spatial correlation in stream water chemistry using three distance measures: straight-line distance, symmetric hydrologic distance, and weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance. We used a dataset collected in Maryland, USA to develop both general linear models and geostatistical models (based on the three distance measures) for acid neutralizing capacity, conductivity, pH, nitrate, sulfate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon. The spatial AICC methodology allowed us to fit the autocorrelation and covariate parameters simultaneously and to select the model with the most support in the data. We used the universal kriging algorithm to generate geostatistical model predictions. We found that spatial correlation exists in stream chemistry data at a relatively coarse scale and that geostatistical models consistently improved the accuracy of model predictions. More than one distance measure performed well for most chemical response variables, but straight-line distance appears to be the most suitable distance measure for regional geostatistical modeling. It may be necessary to develop new survey designs that more fully capture spatial correlation at a variety of scales to improve the use of weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance measures in regional geostatistical models.},

  abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is an intrinsic characteristic in freshwater stream environments where nested watersheds and flow connectivity may produce patterns that are not captured by Euclidean distance. Yet, many common autocovariance functions used in geostatistical models are statistically invalid when Euclidean distance is replaced with hydrologic distance. We use simple worked examples to illustrate a recently developed moving-average approach used to construct two types of valid autocovariance models that are based on hydrologic distances. These models were designed to represent the spatial configuration, longitudinal connectivity, discharge, and flow direction in a stream network. They also exhibit a different covariance structure than Euclidean models and represent a true difference in the way that spatial relationships are represented. Nevertheless, the multi-scale complexities of stream environments may not be fully captured using a model based on one covariance structure. We advocate using a variance component approach, which allows a mixture of autocovariance models (Euclidean and stream models) to be incorporated into a single geostatistical model. As an example, we fit and compare "mixed models," based on multiple covariance structures, for a biological indicator. The mixed model proves to be a flexible approach because many sources of information can be incorporated into a single model. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Ecological Society or America.},

DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently, some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs. We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally, we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors). \textcopyright{} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS and Commonwealth of Australia.},

We used visual surveys, electrofishing, and mark\textendash recapture techniques to quantify brook trout spawning intensity, population density, size structure, and demographic rates (apparent sur-vival and immigration) throughout the watershed. Our analyses produced the following results. Spawning by brook trout was concentrated in streams with small basin areas (i.e., segments draining less than 3 km 2), relatively high alkalinity (Ͼ10 mg CaCO 3 /L), and high amounts of instream cover. The spatial distribution of juvenile and small-adult brook trout within the watershed was relatively stable and was significantly correlated with spawning intensity. However, no such re-lationship was observed for large adults, which exhibited highly variable distribution patterns related to seasonally important habitat features, including instream cover, stream depth and width, and riparian canopy cover. Brook trout survival and immigration rates varied seasonally, spatially, and among size-classes. Differential survival and immigration tended to concentrate juveniles and small adults in small, alkaline streams, whereas dispersal tended to redistribute large adults at the watershed scale. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variations in spawning, survival, and movement interact to determine the distribution, abundance, and size structure of brook trout populations at a watershed scale. These results underscore the importance of small tributaries for the persistence of brook trout in this watershed and the need to consider watershed-scale processes when designing management plans for Appalachian brook trout populations.}

The study area experienced extremely high seasonal, yearly, and among-stream variability in water temperature and flow. The relative mobility of brook trout within the upper Shavers Fork watershed varied significantly depending on whether individuals resided within the larger main stem or the smaller tributary. The movement rate of trout inhabiting the main stem during summer months (50 m/d) was an order of magnitude higher than that of tributary fish (2 m/d). Movement rates of main-stem-resident brook trout during summer were correlated with the maximum water temperature experienced by the fish and with the fish's initial distance from a known coldwater source. For main-stem trout, use of microhabitats closer to cover was higher during extremely warm periods than during cooler periods; use of microhabitats closer to cover during warm periods was also greater for main-stem trout than for tributary inhabitants. Main-stem-resident trout were never observed in water exceeding 19.5\textdegree C. Our study provides some of the first data on brook trout movements in a large Appalachian river system and underscores the importance of managing trout fisheries in a riverscape context. Brook trout conservation in this region will depend on restoration and protection of coldwater refugia in larger river main stems as well as removal of barriers to trout movement near tributary and main-stem confluences. \textcopyright{} American Fisheries Society 2012.}

  abstract = {The hypothesis that animal population dynamics may be synchronized by climate1 is highly relevant in the context of climate change because it suggests that several populations might respond simultaneously to climatic trends if their dynamics are entrained by environmental correlation. The dynamics of many species throughout the Northern Hemisphere are influenced by a single large-scale climate system, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)2,3, which exerts highly correlated regional effects on local weather4. But efforts to attribute synchronous fluctuations of contiguous populations to large-scale climate are confounded by the synchronizing influences of dispersal or trophic interactions5. Here we report that the dynamics of caribou and musk oxen on opposite coasts of Greenland show spatial synchrony among populations of both species that correlates with the NAO index. Our analysis shows that the NAO has an influence in the high degree of cross-species synchrony between pairs of caribou and musk oxen populations separated by a minimum of 1,000\,km of inland ice. The vast distances, and complete physical and ecological separation of these species, rule out spatial coupling by dispersal or interaction. These results indicate that animal populations of different species may respond synchronously to global climate change over large regions.},

  abstract = {Fishes inhabiting streams and rivers in the interior of North America experience a continental climate. Water temperatures reach 0 \textdegree C in winter and are high in summer. There is a marked seasonal cycle in discharge. These circumstances make groundwater a crucial component of river habitats. Groundwater can influence the distribution, reproductive success, biomass and productivity, behaviour and movements of fishes, and is especially important in winter and summer. Winter flows are minimal and are affected by ice. In winter, the importance of groundwater increases northwards. Groundwater provides overwintering habitat free of subsurface ice and fish may migrate long distances to take advantage of it. The melt season can account for up to half the annual discharge. In summer, groundwater is important for maintaining discharge and moderating stream temperatures. During critically hot weather, groundwater r\'efugia protect species exposed to temperatures approaching their thermal limits. Since groundwater exerts such an important influence on river habitats, its quality, quantity and sustainability should be considered before development proposals are approved which could alter it. Examples of the role of groundwater in the ecology of some species show how localised and critical habitats influenced by groundwater can be, and, in consequence, how necessary it is to protect them. Protection is complicated because groundwater distribution pathways are often unknown and recharge areas may be remote from discharges. Scale becomes important in identifying potential risks to critical stream habitats from all types of landscape modification and water abstraction. Groundwater temperatures reflect mean annual air temperatures and are likely to change as global climates respond to increases in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This could profoundly change critical fish habitats, particularly those at the margins of species distributions or those that are already overcrowded. Such considerations emphasise the importance of developing proper strategies for the conservation of groundwater. Copyright \textcopyright 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Community changes along an elevational gradient from 2,234 to 1,230 m above mean sea level reflected a combination of zonation and downstream addition of species. Zonation was evident on a broad spatial scale as a result of stream temperatures. A coldwater trout (Salmonidae) assemblage dominated headwater reaches but was replaced by a warmwater minnow-sucker (Cyprinidae-Catostomidae) assemblage below 2,000 m. Within the warmwater zone, fish community change was due mainly to the addition of new species downstream. Headwater sites were dominated by members of the insectivore feeding guild, and other trophic guilds were added downstream. The major gradient of habitat change downstream consisted of a decrease in pool habitat and increases in stream width, depth, current velocity, turbidity, and proportion of the channel consisting of run habitat. Minor gradients of habitat change involved streambank condition and substrate particle size. Contrary to streams in forested regions, habitat diversity did not increase downstream, suggesting that increased living space and moderating environmental conditions contributed to the downstream increase in species richness. Local habitat modification due to cattle grazing or alterations in stream flow caused minor changes in fish assemblages but did not disrupt the dominant longitudinal patterns. Broad-scale zonation based on temperature regime and additive patterns within zones should typify other streams originating in montane regions. \textcopyright{} 1991 by the American fisheries society.}

  abstract = {Quantile regression is a method of estimating fish weight at length for alternate portions of a probability distribution, but it is an approach that has not received much attention in fisheries literature. Quantile regression can provide estimates of any quantile of weight at length without bias (including the 75th quantile, which was often the focus of standard weight [Ws] equations), and this is more advantageous than previously defined Ws equations derived from linear or quadratic regression methods. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the utility of quantile regression as a tool to assess fish weight at length at various portions of the probability distribution without bias using Walleye Sander vitreus as a case study. Quantile regression models at the 75th quantile were developed for three randomly selected Walleye populations from Georgia and South Dakota and compared with a large (N~=~33,589) reference population. Bootstrap resampling procedures indicated that only one population from the state of Georgia had an intercept and slope similar to the reference population. For the one population that had similar intercept and slope to the reference population, predictions of weight at various lengths still fell below the 95\% CIs for predicted weights of the reference population, suggesting that slight differences in intercepts and slopes in allometric relationships can result in predicted weights that still differ at some lengths. Predicted weights of Walleye derived from the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles were used to demonstrate how individuals and populations may be compared at different management targets. Overall, this study demonstrates the relative ease with which quantile regression may be used to compare fish body condition between populations without bias.},

There is considerable level of species-specific synchrony in population fluctuations among the localities. The degree of synchrony levels off with increasing distance among the populations compared. Climatic perturbations and dispersal have been proposed as pace-making factors for synchrony. According to Moran's theorem, local populations sharing a common structure of density dependence should become synchronized under the influence of a spatially correlated density-independent factor. This predicts synchrony to decay slower with increasing distance between local populations than if the synchrony is caused by dispersal. To explore the significance of the Moran effect and dispersal in explaining the observed regional synchrony, we used a metapopulation system. The Moran effect and dispersal are both capable to synchronize alone local population fluctuations. However, with dispersal the level of synchrony decreases with distance among the populations. Adding Moran's effect does not greatly affect the level of synchrony, nor the negative correlation between synchrony and distance. This finding makes it difficult to tell apart whether an observed negative correlation between the level of synchrony and distance among the compared populations is caused by dispersal alone, or both dispersal and Moran's effect acting together.},

  abstract = {Changes in the flux of fresh water directed into the North Atlantic may affect thermohaline ocean circulation, resulting in regional climate change. Thermohaline circulation may have been more sensitive to these meltwater flux changes during the last deglaciation when large volumes of fresh meltwater from proglacial lakes on the North American continent discharged into the North Atlantic. This study examines the proglacial lake record in the northern Champlain Valley to determine the chronology and magnitude of meltwater discharge through and from this region. Steady-state (baseflow) meltwater flux is estimated to have been about 0.03\textendash 0.06 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m 3/s), based on threshold morphology. Digital elevation paleo-bathymetric models of the proglacial lakes in the St. Lawrence Lowlands and Champlain Valley were created from mapped strandlines. These models determined that two short duration floods with discharges on the order of 0.1\textendash 0.2 Sv entered the Atlantic Ocean through the Hudson Valley. This was followed about 150\textendash 300 years later by a switch of steady-state flux from the Hudson Valley to the Gulf of St. Lawrence initiated by a 0.1\textendash 0.2 Sv short duration flood pulse to the Atlantic through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. These flood pulses and the switch of the steady-state discharge route may have had a significant impact on thermohaline ocean circulation. Terrestrial organic radiocarbon ages combined with the sedimentary record suggest that the switch in discharge route from the Hudson Valley to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, associated with the final draining of glacial Lake Vermont and the incursion of the Champlain Sea in the Champlain Valley, occurred at about 12,830 years B.P. This is about the same time as the onset of the Younger Dryas cold episode. Deglaciation of the Champlain Valley was emulated using a finite element computer model, paleo-bathymetric meltwater volumes, and simple assumptions about Earth rheology, to see how well a modified ICE-3G glacial model would predict observed isostatic deformation. Mapped strandlines indicate that 13,000 years of isostatic rebound in the Champlain Valley resulted in uplift with nearly linear slope uplift profile trending south to north at 0.8\textendash 0.9 m/km through the Champlain Valley. The model predicted an increasing slope uplift profile trending southeast to northwest at 0.4\textendash 0.5 m/km through the Champlain Valley.},

Freshwater outflow from proglacial lakes in the Hudson/Champlain valleys (glacial lake Albany/Vermont) and the combined Ontario and St. Lawrence valleys (glacial Lake Iroquois) may have affected ocean circulation and thereby altered climate during the last deglaciation. We have estimated steady-state and three flood pulse discharges from these large meltwater reservoirs into the North Atlantic using channel geometry and a high resolution digital elevation model of the Late Wisconsinan paleogeography of the region. We estimate the steady-state meltwater discharge into the North Atlantic to be 0.3\textendash 0.6 Sv. The first flood event was a combined Iroquois/Vermont outflow at around 10,900 14C yr BP that released 700 km3 of meltwater into the North Atlantic through the Hudson Valley with an estimated discharge of 1.1 Sv. A second outflow event released 2500 km3 through the Hudson Valley shortly after the first event. Finally, approximately 1500 km3 was released to the North Atlantic through the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the incursion of the Champlain Sea about 150\textendash 300 years later.},

  abstract = {Populations occurring at species' range edges can be locally adapted to unique environmental conditions. From a species' perspective, range-edge environments generally have higher severity and frequency of extreme climatic events relative to the range core. Under future climates, extreme climatic events are predicted to become increasingly important in defining species' distributions. Therefore, range-edge genotypes that are better adapted to extreme climates relative to core populations may be essential to species' persistence during periods of rapid climate change. We use relatively simple conceptual models to highlight the importance of locally adapted range-edge populations (leading and trailing edges) for determining the ability of species to persist under future climates. Using trees as an example, we show how locally adapted populations at species' range edges may expand under future climate change and become more common relative to range-core populations. We also highlight how large-scale habitat destruction occurring in some geographic areas where many species range edge converge, such as biome boundaries and ecotones (e.g., the arc of deforestation along the rainforest-cerrado ecotone in the southern Amazonia), can have major implications for global biodiversity. As climate changes, range-edge populations will play key roles in helping species to maintain or expand their geographic distributions. The loss of these locally adapted range-edge populations through anthropogenic disturbance is therefore hypothesized to reduce the ability of species to persist in the face of rapid future climate change.},

Sampling was carried out by electrofishing from 1994 to 1999. The fish were split into two age classes (0+ and {$>$}0+) using length-frequency distribution analysis. No autocorrelation was present in our time series. There were significant correlations of densities between sites for stone loach ({$>$}0+) and gudgeon (0+), but not for European minnow. A significant positive relationship was observed between maximal flow values and 0+ gudgeon density. No significant associations between flow variables and density were observed for stone loach. These results emphasize the role of external factors in effecting population dynamics, and suggest that their influences differ according to life stage and life-history characteristics.},

  abstract = {Population synchrony over various geographical scales is known from a large number of taxa. Three main hypotheses have been put forward as explanations to this phenomenon. First, correlated environmental disturbances (so called Moran effect). Moran showed that at least for linear models, the population synchrony would exactly match that of the corresponding environment. Second, the migration, or dispersal, of individuals is liable to cause population synchrony. Third, nomadic predators have been proposed as a synchronising mechanism. In this paper, I analyse the first two explanations by linearizing a general population model with spatial structure. From this linear approximation I derive an expression for the population synchrony. The major results are: 1) Population synchrony can vary significantly depending on the timing of the population census. 2) The environmental correlation is always important. It sets the 'base level' of synchrony. 3) Dispersal is only an effective synchronising mechanism when the local dynamics are at least close to unstable. 4) These results are valid even in a model with delayed density dependence - with possibly cyclic dynamics. Time tag structure has little effect on synchrony. Some of the predictions presented here are supported by data from the literature.}

The resulting gene flow from facilitating migration may improve fitness and adaptive potential, but is not without risks (e.g., outbreeding depression). Here, we conducted a test of genetic rescue by translocating ten (five of each sex) brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from a single source to four nearby and isolated stream populations. To control for the demographic contribution of translocated individuals, ten resident individuals (five of each sex) were removed from each recipient population. Prior to the introduction of translocated individuals, the two smallest above-barrier populations had substantially lower genetic diversity, and all populations had reduced effective number of breeders relative to adjacent below-barrier populations. In the first reproductive bout following translocation, 31 of 40 (78\%) translocated individuals reproduced successfully. Translocated individuals contributed to more families than expected under random mating and generally produced larger full-sibling families. We observed relatively high ({$>$}20\%) introgression in three of the four recipient populations. The translocations increased genetic diversity of recipient populations by 45\% in allelic richness and 25\% in expected heterozygosity. Additionally, strong evidence of hybrid vigour was observed through significantly larger body sizes of hybrid offspring relative to resident offspring in all recipient populations. Continued monitoring of these populations will test for negative fitness effects beyond the first generation. However, these results provide much-needed experimental data to inform the potential effectiveness of genetic rescue-motivated translocations.},

  abstract = {The ``restricted-movement paradigm'' (RMP) states that adult fish in streams are sedentary and spend most of their lives in short (20\textendash 50 m) reaches of stream. In mark\textendash recapture studies, however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: one represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15\textendash 0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was {$<$}100 m for 24 populations and was typically {$<$}50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19\%) and exceeded 50\% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP, appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.},

  abstract = {In June 1995, a massive flood and debris flow impacted fish and habitat along the lower 1.9 km of the Staunton River, a headwater stream located in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. In the area affected by debris flow, the stream bed was scoured and new substrate materials were deposited, trees were removed from a 30-m-wide band in the riparian area, and all fish were eliminated. In the area that was unaffected by debris flow, habitat was moderately altered by the flood and fish populations persisted at decreased densities. Basinwide fish population and habitat surveys provided data to compare (1) the pre- and postevent population densities of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and instream habitat conditions and (2) postevent population density, brook trout growth, and instream habitat in the debris-flow-affected and unaffected areas. By June 1998, brook trout had recolonized the entire debris-flow-affected area, and population density exceeded preevent levels. Brook trout growth was significantly greater in the debris-flow-affected area than in the unaffected area through fall 1998, but it was not significantly greater in 1999. Population density appeared to have a negative influence on fish growth. A 1995 postevent habitat survey revealed increases in the number of pools and riffles and substrate size and decreases in pool and riffle surface area and depth. By 1999, the total number, surface area, and depth of pools and riffles had returned to near preevent levels and substrate size had decreased. Between 1995 and 1999, the amount of large woody debris increased in the debris-flow-unaffected area, where riparian trees had remained intact, and decreased in the affected area, where riparian trees had been eliminated. A number of factors, including a relatively intact watershed and nearby source populations, allowed the Staunton River to quickly respond to this dramatic natural event. Given the proper conditions for recovery, such events are less catastrophic than activities that lead to chronic stream degradation.},

The 1996 amendments to this primary United States marine fishery-management law include a new mandate to identify habitats essential to managed living marine resources and to take steps to ensure that those habitats remain healthy and can support sustainable fisheries. Until now, the legislative mandate for protecting habitat for marine and anadromous stocks came through statutes not specifically focused on the needs of commercial and recreational fish species. Now, there is explicit linkage between fishery-management programs, traditionally designed to manage the harvesting activity itself, and efforts to ensure that fishing and nonfishing activities do not undermine the productivity of the stocks. This emphasis on habitat health and productivity brings a broader ecosystem perspective to traditional fishery management. The insertion of essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions into fisheries management has been an enormous undertaking. The agency and the regional fishery management councils, working with other partners, completed the first stage of the process within very tight statutory deadlines. The councils have made use of all of the tools provided them under the act and the EFH regulations, such as designating habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs), recommending fishing restrictions within special areas, defining priority research and information needs, and documenting threats and conservation measures appropriate for federal actions that may adversely affect EFH. This effort has entailed a great deal of scientific as well as policy analysis. We are currently implementing the federal consultation process to address threats to fish habitat in a consistent and timely manner. This new habitat thrust will align fishery managers and scientists with new allies in the habitat arena, increasing benefits to marine resource-management programs and fishery management. As suggested by the theme of this issue, an understanding and consideration of marine reserves and other special-area management concepts can benefit federal fishery management. This article gives an overview of how the fishery-management councils are fulfilling the essential fish habitat mandate by using a broader ecosystem approach to conservation that considers the ecological role of managed species, analyzes species' habitat needs from state waters to the high seas, and examines shifts in population health and sustainability over the course of decades.},

Recent theoretical and empirical studies of source-sink systems demonstrate that temporally variable local growth rates in sinks can substantially increase average abundance of a persisting population, provided that the variation is positively autocorrelated\textemdash in effect, temporal variation inflates average abundance. Here we extend these results to a metapopulation in which all habitat patches are sinks. Using numerical studies of a population with discrete generations (buttressed by analytic results), we show that temporal variation and moderate dispersal can jointly permit indefinite persistence of the metapopulation and that positive autocorrelation both lowers the magnitude of variation required for persistence and increases the average abundance of persisting metapopulations. These effects are weakened\textemdash but not destroyed\textemdash if variation in local growth rates is spatially synchronized and dispersal is localized. We show that the inflationary effect is robust to a number of extensions of the basic model, including demographic stochasticity and density dependence. Because ecological and environmental processes contributing to temporally variable growth rates in natural populations are typically autocorrelated, these observations may have important implications for species persistence.},

Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews studies that have analyzed the effects of local weather and large-scale climate phenomenon on fluctuations in the size of bird populations. Population size depends upon birth rates and death rates and how these interact with density. The variation in these relationships is also important. By understanding how these interact to affect variation in population size, one can examines how climate change may affect the future fluctuations of bird populations. There are three major issues to consider in understanding how climate change may result in changes in population size: whether the climate responses are density dependent or density independent; whether climate change largely affects the reproductive success or the survival; and whether climate change primarily affects the mean values or the variability. The chapter outlines a general theoretical framework based on Lande et al. for analyzing avian population dynamics and describes how an expected change in climate may affect avian population dynamics and thus help resolve the three issues. Modeling and estimating the effects of the density dependence as well as changes in the mean and variance of the relevant climate variables have been discussed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Climate changes affect aquatic ecosystems by altering temperatures and precipitation patterns, and the rear edges of the distributions of cold-water species are especially sensitive to these effects. The main goal of this study was to predict in detail how changes in air temperature and precipitation will affect streamflow, the thermal habitat of a cold-water fish (the brown trout, \emph{Salmo trutta}), and the synergistic relationships among these variables at the rear edge of the natural distribution of brown trout. Thirty-one sites in 14 mountain rivers and streams were studied in central Spain. Models of streamflow were built for several of these sites using M5 model trees, and a non-linear regression method was used to estimate stream temperatures. Nine global climate models simulations for Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were downscaled to the local level. Significant reductions in streamflow were predicted to occur in all of the basins (max. -49 \%) by the year 2099, and seasonal differences were noted between the basins. The stream temperature models showed relationships between the model parameters, geology and hydrologic responses. Temperature was sensitive to streamflow in one set of streams, and summer reductions in streamflow contributed to additional stream temperature increases (max. 3.6 \textdegree C), although the sites that are most dependent on deep aquifers will likely resist warming to a greater degree. The predicted increases in water temperatures were as high as 4.0 \textdegree C. Temperature and streamflow changes will cause a shift in the rear edge of the distribution of this species. However, geology will affect the extent of this shift. Approaches like the one used herein have proven to be useful in planning the prevention and mitigation of the negative effects of climate change by differentiating areas based on the risk level and viability of fish populations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We examined the effects of low-head dams on aquatic biota, habitat, and water quality in a 171-km reach of a midwestern warmwater river that was fragmented by 15 dams into a series of free-flowing and impounded habitats. Dams impounded 55\% of the river's surface area within the study reach and influenced distributions of 30 species of fish by restricting upstream movements. Values for the Illinois index of biotic integrity (IBI) were higher in free-flowing areas (mean IBI = 46 out of a possible 60 at below-dam and midsegment free-flowing locations) than impounded areas (mean IBI {$<$} 31 for above-dam and midsegment impounded locations). Likewise, scores from a macroinvertebrate condition index (MCI) were higher at stations in free-flowing reaches (mean MCI {$>$} 415 out of a possible 700) than in nearshore areas of impounded reaches (mean MCI {$<$} 210). Ponar dredge samples taken only from open-water impounded areas showed an offshore invertebrate community that consisted almost entirely of tolerant oligochaetes and chironomid larvae. Qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI) scores indicated good-quality habitat in free-flowing areas (mean QHEI {$>$} 70 out of a possible 100) and severely degraded habitat at impounded sites (mean QHEI {$<$} 45). In impounded reaches, dissolved oxygen and pH showed wide daily fluctuations (2.5-18.0 mg/L and 7.0-9.4 units) and often failed to meet Illinois water quality standards. In free-flowing portions of river, fluctuations in these parameters were less extreme and water quality standards typically were met. We found little evidence of cumulative effects of dams; however, our data suggest that low-head dams adversely affect warmwater stream fish and macroinvertebrate communities by degrading habitat and water quality and fragmenting the river landscape. These results should aid river managers and stakeholders in determining appropriate restoration practices (i.e., dam removal versus fish passage structures) for warmwater rivers and streams that contain low-head dams. \textcopyright{} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.},

An analysis of over 50 years of data on sockeye salmon returns to the rivers of Bristol Bay, Alaska, shows just how important this portfolio effect \textemdash{} so-called by analogy with risk-spreading in financial markets \textemdash{} can be. The sockeye salmon fishery is one of the most valuable in the United States, with more than 60\% of it coming from this region. The fact that it is made up of several hundred discrete populations makes the observed population variability about half what would be expected in a single homogenous population, and numerical modelling predicts that a homogenous population would be subject to ten times more fisheries closures. In terms of fisheries management, this work suggests that reducing the homogenizing effects of hatcheries on genetic diversity, protecting weak stocks from over-harvesting in mixed stock fisheries, and maintaining intact habitat networks should be prioritized.},

The ``portfolio'' concept when applied to ecological research provides important insights into how ecosystems are organized, how species interact, and how evolutionary strategies develop. It also helps identify appropriate scales for developing robust management and conservation schemes, and offers an approach that does not rely on prescriptive predictions about threats in an uncertain future.

Total density of adult fish differed little between years but large changes in juvenile abundance occurred between years in association with differences in hydrologic regime. High stream discharge had little influence on abundance of juvenile suckers and darters, but some minnow species and all sunfish species exhibited large increases in juvenile abundance during stable to low flow conditions. The largest increase in juvenile abundance occurred among species with prolonged breeding seasons: bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus) and striped shiner (Notropis chrysocephalus). Increased juvenile abundance during stable flow conditions resulted in increased species richness in small habitat patches and annual changes in species composition of the community.

To effectively manage IEP, it is important to efficiently detect their presences and determine their distribution patterns. Remote sensing has been a useful tool to map IEP but its application is limited in urban forests, which are often the sources and sinks for IEP. In this study, we examined the feasibility and tradeoffs of species level IEP mapping using multiple remote sensing techniques in a highly complex urban forest setting. Bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), a pervasive IEP in eastern North America, was used as our modeling species. Both medium spatial resolution (MSR) and high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery were employed in bush honeysuckle mapping. The importance of spatial scale was also examined using an up-scaling simulation from the HSR object based classification. Analysis using both MSR and HSR imagery provided viable results for IEP distribution mapping in urban forests. Overall mapping accuracy ranged from 89.8\% to 94.9\% for HSR techniques and from 74.6\% to 79.7\% for MSR techniques. As anticipated, classification accuracy reduces as pixel size increases. HSR based techniques produced the most desirable results, therefore is preferred for precise management of IEP in heterogeneous environment. However, the ue of MSR techniques should not be ruled out given their wide availability and moderate accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous larger scale models have been useful in highlighting the potential threat; however, the predicted air and water temperature errors associated with these models makes predictions of the persistence of individual brook trout populations problematic. We directly measured paired air and water temperatures in watersheds (N = 77) containing reproducing populations of brook trout in Virginia. We found that paired air and water temperature relationships are highly variable among patches but are a useful dataset to classify sensitivity and vulnerability of existing brook trout patches. We developed a classification system using sensitivity and vulnerability metrics that classified sampled brook trout habitats into four categories (High Sensitivity- High Vulnerability (51.9\% ); High Sensitivity-Low Vulnerability (10.4 \% ); Low Sensitivity- High Vulnerability (7.8 \% ); Low Sensitivity-Low Vulnerability (29.9 \% ).

  abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly discovering that ecological processes are made up of components that are multi-scaled in space and time. Some of the most complex of these processes are cross-scale interactions (CSIs), which occur when components interact across scales. When undetected, such interactions may cause errors in extrapolation from one region to another. CSIs, particularly those that include a regional scaled component, have not been systematically investigated or even reported because of the challenges of acquiring data at sufficiently broad spatial extents. We present an approach for quantifying CSIs and apply it to a case study investigating one such interaction, between local and regional scaled land-use drivers of lake phosphorus. Ultimately, our approach for investigating CSIs can serve as a basis for efforts to understand a wide variety of multi-scaled problems such as climate change, land-use/land-cover change, and invasive species.},

To examine the errors associated with this procedure, linear relationships between stream temperatures, T, and air temperatures, Ta, recorded for 11 streams in the central U.S. (Mississippi River basin) were analyzed. Weather stations were an average 42 miles (range 0 to 144 miles) from the rivers. The general equations, Tw= 5.0 + 0.75 Ta and Tw= 2.9 + 0.86 Ta with temperatures in \textdegree C, were derived for daily and weekly water temperatures, respectively, for the 11 streams studied. The simulations had a standard deviation between measurements and predictions of 2.7\textdegree C (daily) and 2.1\textdegree C (weekly). Equations derived for each specific stream individually gave lower standard deviations, i.e., 2.1\textdegree C and 1.4\textdegree C, respectively. Small, shallow streams had smaller deviations than large, deep rivers. The measured water temperatures follow the air temperatures closely with some time lag. time lags ranged from hours to days, increasing with stream depth. Taking into account these time lags improved the daily temperature predictions slightly. Periods of ice cover were excluded from the analysis.},

Previous work has assumed that stream fish communities will show either persistence about an equilibrium because of strong density-dependent processes or random variation in structure as a result of environmental stochasticity. In a 10-year study of a California stream, fish community structure changed under the influence of storm-induced high discharge events that impacted recruitment. Species' relative abundances were altered as pre-recruitment stream discharges differentially influenced year-class strength among species with contrasting life histories. Simulation of stream fish community assembly under flow-driven recruitment variation indicates that community structure will vary depending on how particular high-flow events affect species' relative abundances and ongoing density-dependent processes, including competition and predation. Results suggest that stream fish communities are likely to show alternate states rather than a single persistent equilibrium. However, community assembly will not be random but will depend on situation-specific interactions between density-independent and density-dependent processes.},

No efforts to remove rainbow trout or enhance brook trout populations were made in these streams during the 7-16-year intervals between surveys. Compared with the earlier surveys, brook trout distributions receded (lower elevation increased) in nine streams (36\%), advanced (lower elevation decreased) in eight streams (32\%), and did not change in eight streams (32\%). The average total change in stream length occupied by brook trout was a 109-m downstream increase (SE = 82) with a mean annual increase of 8 m (SE = 6). Neither average total change nor annual change was significant (P {$>$} 0.19). Additionally, the highest elevations at which rainbow trout were present (determined in 10 streams) increased in four streams but decreased in six. The average total change in stream length occupied by rainbow trout was a 158-m decrease in elevation (SE = 151) with a mean annual change of -14 m (SE = 13). Neither average total change nor mean annual change was significant (P {$>$} 0.30). We concluded that rainbow trout were not affecting the downstream limit of most brook trout populations where the two species occurred sympatrically in Tennessee. Further. after examining published data from Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we found no evidence that the downstream limits of brook trout distribution in most streams were affected by the presence of rainbow trout between the 1950s and 1970s. These data support an emerging theory that the distributional limits of brook trout and rainbow trout in sympatry in the southern Appalachian Mountains will ebb and flow upstream and downstream over time.},

Data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) transect counts were used to investigate the decline in synchrony of population fluctuations with increasing distance between sample units, and to evaluate the relative effects to local and regional scale processes on population fluctuations. 2. Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on different transects. 3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2 km. 4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally correlated weather patterns. 5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying that widespread environmental stochasticity is of overriding importance at this scale. 6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r2 values attributable to them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal environmental stochasticity.},

In streams where groundwater inputs are significant, energy input through advection can also be an important control on stream temperature. For an individual stream reach, models of stream temperature can take advantage of direct measurement or estimation of these energy inputs for a given river channel environment. Understanding spatial patterns of stream temperature at a landscape scale requires predicting how this environment varies through space, and under different atmospheric conditions. At the landscape scale, air temperature is often used as a surrogate for the dominant controls on stream temperature. In this study we show that, in regions where groundwater inputs are key controls and the degree of groundwater input varies in space, air temperature alone is unlikely to explain within-landscape stream temperature patterns. We illustrate how a geologic template can offer insight into landscape-scale patterns of stream temperature and its predictability from air temperature relationships. We focus on variation in stream temperature within headwater streams within the McKenzie River basin in western Oregon. In this region, as in other areas of the Pacific Northwest, fish sensitivity to summer stream temperatures continues to be a pressing environmental issue. We show that, within the McKenzie, streams which are sourced from deeper groundwater reservoirs versus shallow subsurface flow systems have distinct summer temperature regimes. Groundwater streams are colder, less variable and less sensitive to air temperature variation. We use these results from the western Oregon Cascade hydroclimatic regime to illustrate a conceptual framework for developing regional-scale indicators of stream temperature variation that considers the underlying geologic controls on spatial variation, and the relative roles played by energy and water inputs.

  abstract = {1 Synchronous fluctuations of the abundance of several populations at a regional scale can be a sign of a climatic effect on their dynamics (Moran effect). However, the interpretation of spatial synchrony is often complicated by the interaction between climatic disturbances and migrations between the studied populations. 2 We addressed this question by studying 24-year time-series of abundance estimates for four populations of four fish species in three different catchment basins in C\^ote d'Ivoire (West Africa). As localities from two different basins cannot exchange individuals, dispersal cannot be considered a synchronizing factor in this system. 3 A sign test performed on the four site \texttimes{} site correlation matrices rejected the null hypothesis of no spatial synchrony. No relation was detected in relating the level of synchrony in species dynamics (r = 0{$\cdot$}58 on average) to the geographical distances between the four sites (176\textendash 367 km). A more detailed analysis taking account of sampling error was carried out between two sites, and confirmed the above results. When corrected for sampling noise, high values of spatial synchrony were obtained (r = 0{$\cdot$}88 on average). 4 Interspecific spatial synchronies (r = 0{$\cdot$}57 on average) were almost as high as intraspecific values, suggesting that the four species are reacting in the same way to the same Moran effect. 5 A good correlation (r = 0{$\cdot$}54) between a regional river discharge index and the total catch of the four species 1 year later was observed, suggesting that hydrological variability is one of the main synchronizing factors. Moreover, as expected on theoretical grounds, spatial synchrony in river discharge (r = 0{$\cdot$}84 and 0{$\cdot$}88 on a log scale) is similar to spatial synchrony in population dynamics (r = 0{$\cdot$}88 on average and corrected for sampling error).},

  abstract = {Intraspecific population diversity (specifically, spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature. In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems, an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry. Here, we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations. In riverine systems, each branch (i.e., tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics, and confluences serve as ``merging'' points of those branches. Hence, increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape. We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony. Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems, metapopulation size (a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability. These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes. A strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is likely to be a pervasive feature of branching networks that strongly affects species persistence during rapid environmental changes.},

Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 km2 in the northwestern USA, for 1 year, including a detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7\textdegree C and 1.2\textdegree C, with biases of +0.1\textdegree C and -0.1\textdegree C, respectively. MAE for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3\%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3\%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal sealing of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps.}

Here we formulate a model to predict daily averaged river water temperature as a function of air temperature and discharge, with the latter variable being more relevant in some specific cases (e.g., snowmelt-fed rivers, rivers impacted by hydropower production). The model uses a hybrid formulation characterized by a physically based structure associated with a stochastic calibration of the parameters. The interpretation of the parameter values allows for better understanding of river thermal dynamics and the identification of the most relevant factors affecting it. The satisfactory agreement of different versions of the model with measurements in three different rivers (root mean square error smaller than 1oC, at a daily timescale) suggests that the proposed model can represent a useful tool to synthetically describe medium- and long-term behavior, and capture the changes induced by varying external conditions.},

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and subsequent two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant difference in microhabitat use by brook and non-native trout within restored pools. We also detected a significant difference in microhabitat use by brook trout occupying pools in allopatry versus those occupying pools in sympatry with non-native trout\textemdash a pattern that appears to be modulated by size. Smaller brook trout often occupied pools in the absence of non-native species, where they used shallower and faster focal habitats. Larger brook trout occupied pools with, and utilized similar focal habitats (i.e. deeper, slower velocity) as, non-native trout. Non-native trout consistently occupied more thermally suitable microhabitats closer to cover as compared to brook trout, including the use of thermal refugia (i.e. ambient\textendash focal temperature {$>$}2\textdegree C). These results suggest that non-native trout influence brook trout use of restored habitats by: (1) displacing smaller brook trout from restored pools, and (2) displacing small and large brook trout from optimal microhabitats (cooler, deeper, and lower velocity). Consequently, benefits of habitat restoration in large rivers may only be fully realized by brook trout in the absence of non-native species. Future research within this and other large river systems should characterize brook trout response to stream restoration following removal of non-native species.},

However, spatial variability in the relationship between changes in air temperature to changes in water temperature complicates predictions. We directly measured paired summer air and water temperatures over 2 years in a stratified representative sample of watersheds ({$<$}1\textendash 274 km2) supporting wild Brook Trout throughout Virginia near the southern edge of the species distribution. We used the temperature data to rank streams in terms of two important components of habitat vulnerability: sensitivity (predicted change in water temperature per unit increase in air temperature) and exposure (predicted frequency, magnitude, and duration of threshold water temperatures). Across all sites, sensitivity was substantially lower (median sensitivity = 0.35\textdegree C) than the 0.80\textdegree C assumed in some previous models. Median sensitivity across all sites did not differ between the 2 years of the study. In contrast, median exposure was considerably greater in 2010 (a particularly warm summer) than in 2009, but exposure ranks of habitat patches were highly consistent. Variation in sensitivity and exposure among habitat patches was influenced by landscape metrics (percent forested riparian corridor, patch area, and elevation), but considerable unexplained variation in sensitivity and exposure among sites was likely due to local-scale differences in the extent of groundwater influence. Overall, our direct measurement approach identified significantly more Brook Trout habitat patches with low sensitivity and low exposure that may persist under warming air temperatures than did previous large-scale models. Our sensitivity and exposure classification should provide a useful general framework for managers in making investment decisions for protecting and restoring Brook Trout habitat.Received September 2, 2011; accepted August 9, 2013},

Twenty-eight independent variables related to the hydroperiod, anthropogenic impacts, landscape and structural variables were tested in relation to temporal patterns. Synchronised lakes groups were identified for all species, with differential associations with variables.

  abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology}

Here we assess the impact of climate change on global river flows and river water temperatures, and identify regions that might become more critical for freshwater ecosystems and water use sectors. We used a global physically based hydrological-water temperature modelling framework forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected general circulation model (GCM) output for both the SRES A2 and B1 emissions scenario. This resulted in global projections of daily river discharge and water temperature under future climate. Our results show an increase in the seasonality of river discharge (both increase in high flow and decrease in low flow) for about one-third of the global land surface area for 2071\textendash 2100 relative to 1971\textendash 2000. Global mean and high (95th percentile) river water temperatures are projected to increase on average by 0.8\textendash 1.6 (1.0\textendash 2.2)\textdegree C for the SRES B1\textendash A2 scenario for 2071\textendash 2100 relative to 1971\textendash 2000. The largest water temperature increases are projected for the United States, Europe, eastern China, and parts of southern Africa and Australia. In these regions, the sensitivities are exacerbated by projected decreases in low flows (resulting in a reduced thermal capacity). For strongly seasonal rivers with highest water temperatures during the low flow period, up to 26\% of the increases in high (95th percentile) water temperature can be attributed indirectly to low flow changes, and the largest fraction is attributable directly to increased atmospheric energy input. A combination of large increases in river temperature and decreases in low flows are projected for the southeastern United States, Europe, eastern China, southern Africa and southern Australia. These regions could potentially be affected by increased deterioration of water quality and freshwater habitats, and reduced water available for human uses such as thermoelectric power and drinking water production.},

There have been very few attempts to develop valid spatial covariance models that incorporate flow, stream distance, or both. The application of typical spatial autocovariance functions based on Euclidean distance, such as the spherical covariance model, are not valid when using stream distance. In this paper we develop a large class of valid models that incorporate flow and stream distance by using spatial moving averages. These methods integrate a moving average function, or kernel, against a white noise process. By running the moving average function upstream from a location, we develop models that use flow, and by construction they are valid models based on stream distance. We show that with proper weighting, many of the usual spatial models based on Euclidean distance have a counterpart for stream networks. Using sulfate concentrations from an example data set, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), we show that models using flow may be more appropriate than models that only use stream distance. For the MBSS data set, we use restricted maximum likelihood to fit a valid covariance matrix that uses flow and stream distance, and then we use this covariance matrix to estimate fixed effects and make kriging and block kriging predictions. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},

These results suggest that high stocking density has the effect of mobilizing triglyceride sources, promoting gluconeogenesis from glycerol, but has little effect on protein metabolism. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical inference provides an alternate way to analyze data that is likely to be more appropriate to conservation biology problems than traditional statistical methods. I contrast Bayesian techniques with traditional hypothesis-testing techniques using examples applicable to conservation. I use a trend analysis of two hypothetical populations to illustrate how easy it is to understand Bayesian results, which are given in terms of probability. Bayesian trend analysis indicated that the two populations had very different chances of declining at biologically important rates. For example, the probability that the first population was declining faster than 5\% per year was 0.00, compared to a probability of 0.86 for the second population. The Bayesian results appropriately identified which population was of greater conservation concern. The Bayesian results contrast with those obtained with traditional hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing indicated that the first population, which the Bayesian analysis indicated had no chance of declining at {$>$}5\% per year, was declining significantly because it was declining at a slow rate and the abundance estimates were precise. Despite the high probability that the second population was experiencing a serious decline, hypothesis testing failed to reject the null hypothesis of no decline because the abundance estimates were imprecise. Finally, I extended the trend analysis to illustrate Bayesian decision theory, which allows for choice between more than two decisions and allows explicit specification of the consequences of various errors. The Bayesian results again differed from the traditional results: the decision analysis led to the conclusion that the first population was declining slowly and the second population was declining rapidly.}

Our approach to the science of hydrology needs to significantly change so that we can understand and predict these implications. Such an adjustment is a necessary prerequisite for the development of sustainable water resource management strategies and to achieve long-term water security for people and the environment. Hydrology requires a paradigm shift in which predictions of system behavior that are beyond the range of previously observed variability or that result from significant alterations of physical (structural) system characteristics become the new norm. To achieve this shift, hydrologists must become both synthesists, observing and analyzing the system as a holistic entity, and analysts, understanding the functioning of individual system components, while operating firmly within a well-designed hypothesis testing framework. Cross-disciplinary integration must become a primary characteristic of hydrologic research, catalyzing new research and nurturing new educational models. The test of our quantitative understanding across atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere will necessarily lie in new approaches to benchmark our ability to predict the regional hydrologic and connected implications of environmental change. To address these challenges and to serve as a catalyst to bring about the necessary changes to hydrologic science, we call for a long-term initiative to address the regional implications of environmental change.},

  abstract = {Predicting the distribution of native stream fishes is fundamental to the management and conservation of many species. Modeling species distributions often consists of quantifying relationships between species occurrence and abundance data at known locations with environmental data at those locations. However, it is well documented that native stream fish distributions can be altered as a result of asymmetric interactions between dominant exotic and subordinate native species. For example, the naturalized exotic Brown Trout Salmo trutta has been identified as a threat to native Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis in the eastern United States. To evaluate large-scale patterns of co-occurrence and to quantify the potential effects of Brown Trout presence on Brook Trout occupancy, we used data from 624 stream sites to fit two-species occupancy models. These models assumed that asymmetric interactions occurred between the two species. In addition, we examined natural and anthropogenic landscape characteristics we hypothesized would be important predictors of occurrence of both species. Estimated occupancy for Brook Trout, from a co-occurrence model with no landscape covariates, at sites with Brown Trout present was substantially lower than sites where Brown Trout were absent. We also observed opposing patterns for Brook and Brown Trout occurrence in relation to percentage forest, impervious surface, and agriculture within the network catchment. Our results are consistent with other studies and suggest that alterations to the landscape, and specifically the transition from a forested catchment to one that contains impervious surface or agriculture, reduces the occurrence probability of wild Brook Trout. Our results, however, also suggest that the presence of Brown Trout results in lower occurrence probability of Brook Trout over a range of anthropogenic landscape characteristics, compared with streams where Brown Trout were absent.Received June 20, 2012; accepted September 25, 2012. \textcopyright{} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

However, land\textendash atmosphere feedback such as moisture recycling can link local land-use change to modifications of remote precipitation, with further knock-on effects on distant river flows. Here, we look at river flow changes caused by both land-use change and water use within the basin, as well as modifications of imported and exported atmospheric moisture. We show that in some of the world's largest basins, precipitation was influenced more strongly by land-use change occurring outside than inside the basin. Moreover, river flows in several non-transboundary basins were considerably regulated by land-use changes in foreign countries. We conclude that regional patterns of land-use change and moisture recycling are important to consider in explaining runoff change, integrating land and water management, and informing water governance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The United States harbors the most diverse temperate freshwater fish fauna in the world with about 790 species represented, about 90\% of which are nongame fishes. From a state-by-state perspective, diversity of fishes in the United States is concentrated in the South, primarily in Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia, each of which supports at least 200 native fish species. Endemicity of fishes is high in both the South and West; in the latter region, up to 70\% of fishes in some drainages (e.g., Colorado River) are endemic. Imperilment apparently is not confined to particular taxonomic groups. Of the five most diverse fish families in the United States, total imperilment ranges from 7\% in the Centrarchidae to 50\% in nonanadromous salmonids and indicates widespread and pervasive degradation of aquatic habitats. Imperilment is most acute in areas of high diversity and/or endemicity (i.e., the southern and western states). States with 20 or more imperiled fishes include Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas. Backlogs in listing species as federally threatened or endangered are most egregious (10 or more backlogged taxa) in Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, and Tennessee.},

The southern United States supports more native fishes than any area of comparable size on the North American continent north of Mexico, but also has a high proportion of its fishes in need of conservation action. The review included 662 native freshwater and diadromous fishes and 24 marine fishes that are significant components of freshwater ecosystems. Of this total, 560 described, freshwater fish species are documented, and 49 undescribed species are included provisionally pending formal description. Described subspecies (86) are recognized within 43 species, 6 fishes have undescribed subspecies, and 9 others are recognized as complexes of undescribed taxa. Extinct, endangered, threatened, or vulnerable status is recognized for 28\% (187 taxa) of southern freshwater and diadromous fishes. To date, 3 southern fishes are known to be extinct throughout their ranges, 2 are extirpated from the study region, and 2 others may be extinct. Of the extant southern fishes, 41 (6\%) are regarded as endangered, 46 (7\%) are regarded as threatened, and 101 (15\%) are regarded as vulnerable. Five marine fishes that frequent fresh water are regarded as vulnerable. Our assessment represents a 75\% increase in jeopardized southern fishes since 1989 and a 125\% increase in 20 years. The trend for fishes in the southern United States is clear; jeopardized fishes are successively being moved from the vulnerable category to that of imminent threat of extinction.},

  abstract = {Redd (nest) surveys for resident brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were conducted annually in a mountain lake in northern New York for 11 years with multiple surveys conducted during the spawning season in eight of those years. Repeated surveys throughout the spawning season allowed us to fit an individually based parametric model and estimate the day of year on which spawning was initiated, reached its midpoint, and ended during each year. Spawning phenology was then assessed relative to (1) mean of maximum daily air temperature and (2) mean of maximum daily water temperature at the lake bottom during summer in each year using a linear model. Elevated temperatures in summer were correlated with a delay in spawning and a reduction in the total number of redds constructed. Increasing the summer mean of maximum daily air temperatures by 1 \textdegree C delayed spawning by approximately 1 week and decreased the total number of redds constructed by nearly 65. Lake spawning brook trout select redd sites based on the presence of discharging groundwater that is relatively constant in temperature within and across years, leading to relatively consistent egg incubation times. Therefore, delayed spawning is likely to delay fry emergence, which could influence emergence synchrony with prey items. This work highlights non-lethal and sub-lethal effects of elevated summer temperatures on native resident salmonids in aquatic environments with limited thermal refugia.},

  abstract = {Scale is a fundamental concept in landscape ecology. We characterize scale by grain and extent and apply it to space, time and classification. When conducting experiments, it is important to be mindful of what scale to sample at; the ``correct'' scale depends on the research question and the organism(s) of interest. Frequently, patterns seen at one scale will be different \textendash{} even opposite \textendash{} at another scale, which introduces difficulties with extrapolating results from one scale to another. In this chapter, I discuss how scale can affect experimental design. In particular, I focus on how scaling up from smaller manipulative experiments to larger landscapes is confounded by three challenges. The first is coarse-graining, which refers to techniques to aggregate fine-scale data without risking the introduction of statistical bias. Second, the middle-number problem describes complex landscape systems with too many variables to model easily but too few to make averaging a meaningful solution. Finally, there is the issue of non-stationarity. Non-stationary processes are those where the means, variance and co-variances change over time \textendash{} often in unpredictable, stochastic ways. I offer suggestions to overcome these challenges, including adoption of the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm, the use of lacunarity metrics or examination of different ``currencies'', such as energy or elements, which are amenable to cross-scale analysis.},

  abstract = {Space-time data are ubiquitous in the environmental sciences. Often, as is the case with atmo- spheric and oceanographic processes, these data contain many different scales of spatial and temporal variability. Such data are often non-stationary in space and time and may involve many observation/prediction locations. These factors can limit the effectiveness of traditional space- time statistical models and methods. In this article, we propose the use of hierarchical space-time models to achieve more flexible models and methods for the analysis of environmental data distributed in space and time. The first stage of the hierarchical model specifies a measurement- error process for the observational data in terms of some 'state' process. The second stage allows for site-specific time series models for this state variable. This stage includes large-scale (e.g. seasonal) variability plus a space-time dynamic process for the 'anomalies'. Much of our interest is with this anomaly proc ess. In the third stage, the parameters of these time series models, which are distributed in space, are themselves given a joint distribution with spatial dependence (Markov random fields). The Bayesian formulation is completed in the last two stages by speci- fying priors on parameters. We implement the model in a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework and apply it to an atmospheric data set of monthly maximum temperature.},

We assessed how asynchrony (i.e. different units responding dissimilarly through time) of species and local communities stabilised metacommunity ecosystem function. Asynchrony of species increased stability of local communities, and asynchrony among local communities enhanced metacommunity stability by a wide range of magnitudes (1\textendash 315\%); this range was positively correlated with the size of the metacommunity. Additionally, asynchronous responses among local communities were linked with species' populations fluctuating asynchronously across space, perhaps stemming from physical and/or competitive differences among local communities. Accordingly, we suggest spatial heterogeneity should be a major focus for maintaining the stability of ecosystem services at larger spatial scales.},

The upstream-most extent of the channel network and the longitudinal continuity and lateral extent of headwaters can be difficult to delineate, however, and people are less likely to recognize the importance of headwaters relative to other portions of a river network. Consequently, headwaters commonly lack the legal protections accorded to other portions of a river network and are more likely to be significantly altered or completely obliterated by land use.},

Here, we examine hunter-gatherer spatial behaviour on a very large scale, using GPS devices worn by Hadza foragers to record 2,078 person-days of movement. Theory in movement ecology suggests that the density and mobility of targeted foods should predict spatial behaviour and that strong gender differences should arise in a hunter-gatherer context. As predicted, we find that men walked further per day, explored more land, followed more sinuous paths and were more likely to be alone. These data are consistent with the ecology of male- and female-targeted foods and suggest that male landscape use is more navigationally challenging in this hunter-gatherer context. Comparisons of Hadza space use with space use data available for non-human primates suggest that the sexual division of labour likely co-evolved with increased sex differences in spatial behaviour and landscape use. Wood et al. examine gender differences in Hadza hunter-gatherer spatial behaviour using 2,078 days of GPS-recorded travel. As predicted from principles of foraging ecology, Hadza men walked further per day, explored more land, followed more sinuous paths and were much more likely to be alone.},

Although Lake Superior populations have been less affected than those in other Great Lakes, these populations still face multiple threats. We characterized lake whitefish diets collected off the Keweenaw Peninsula between 2015 and 2017 and compared results to previous Lake Superior studies. We additionally estimated length-weight relationships to determine whether lake whitefish body condition (i.e., expected weight-at-length) had changed since the 1980s. Diet diversity was low, although individual specialization was moderate to high. Fish transitioned from consuming Diporeia in the spring to Mysis and fish eggs during fall and winter; sphaeriids composed 20\textendash 30\% of diets across all seasons. Compared to findings for other Lake Superior regions, lake whitefish diets comprised lower percentages of high energy items (e.g., Diporeia, Mysis) and higher percentages of low energy items (e.g., sphaeriids). Expected weights in the 2000s and 2010s were lower in the 400- and 500-mm length groups but similar in larger lengths groups compared to the 1980s; condition was highest across all lengths in the 1990s. The observed decline in condition since the 1990s in the 400- and 500-mm length groups, in combination with possibly greater consumption of less energetically profitable items, suggests that lake whitefish {$<$}600 mm or preferred prey resources in this lake region may be experiencing stressors leading to condition declines, although what these stressors are remain unknown.},

We reviewed and synthesized the literature on hydropower-related pulsed flows to guide resource managers in addressing significant impacts while avoiding unnecessary curtailment of hydropower operations. Dams may release pulsed flows in response to needs for peaking power, recreational flows, reservoir storage adjustment for flood control, or to mimic natural peaks in the hydrograph. Depending on timing, frequency, duration, and magnitude, pulsed flows can have adverse or beneficial short and long-term effects on resident or migratory stream fishes. Adverse effects include direct impacts to fish populations due to (1) stranding of fishes along the changing channel margins, (2) downstream displacement of fishes, and (3) reduced spawning and rearing success due to redd/nest dewatering and untimely or obstructed migration. Beneficial effects include: (1) maintenance of habitat for spawning and rearing, and (2) biological cues to trigger spawning, hatching, and migration. We developed a basic conceptual model to predict the effects of different types of pulsed flow, identified gaps in knowledge, and identified research activities to address these gaps. There is a clear need for a quantitative framework incorporating mathematical representations of field and laboratory results on flow, temperature, habitat structure, fish life stages by season, fish population dynamics, and multiple fish species, which can be used to predict outcomes and design mitigation strategies in other regulated streams experiencing pulsed flows.},

In this article, the air\textendash water temperature relationship of the Missouri River is investigated by developing three different machine learning models (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Bootstrap Aggregated Decision Trees (BA-DT)). Standard models (linear regression, non-linear regression, and stochastic models) are also developed and compared to machine learning models. Analyzing the three standard models, the stochastic model clearly outperforms the standard linear model and nonlinear model. All the three machine learning models have comparable results and outperform the stochastic model, with GPR having slightly better results for stations No. 2 and 3, while BA-DT has slightly better results for station No. 1. The machine learning models are very effective tools which can be used for the prediction of daily river temperature.},

Two satellite-based precipitation products, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (3B42 Version 7) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and one reanalysis precipitation product, National Centers for Environment Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) are selected. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to merge multi-source precipitation estimates and streamflow simulations. The results show that merging multi-source precipitation products made little difference to improve streamflow simulation. Merging multi-source streamflow simulations using the BMA generally achieved better performance on streamflow simulation, indicating that this approach is more efficient than merging multi-source precipitation products.},

We explored hypotheses behind long-term temporal variation in density, growth, and survival of brown trout Salmo trutta and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis using data collected over several decades on Michigan's Au Sable River. Regression models developed for these species emphasized the influence of year- class strength on older age-classes, year-class strength being positively related to spawner abundance for both species and negatively related to high spring streamflow conditions for brown trout. Age-class density was also positively associated with high levels of large woody debris (LWD) in streams. Annual growth increments of brown trout and brook trout were often negatively related to increased age-class density and LWD and positively affected by elevated total phosphorus levels, cool summers, and warm winters. Annual survival of trout from age 0 to age 4 was negatively related to intra- and interspecific age-class density, and in three of seven models, positively associated with levels of LWD. Our findings emphasize the importance of year-class strength to trout population dynamics as well as the need to include collection of regional- and local-scale habitat data in studies of trout population dynamics},

  abstract = {The ability to describe regional patterns in trout density would be useful for biologists concerned with population status across large regions as well as managers of rivers at the local scale. Noting the importance of flow conditions at the time of emergence to trout year-class strength in Michigan streams and the influence of age-0 trout abundance on subsequent abundance of older age-classes, we assessed the potential for regional synchrony in the population dynamics of brown trout Salmo trutta and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis among Michigan rivers. We used correlation analyses to look for regional synchrony in May stream discharge (approximating the time of brown trout fry emergence) and fall trout density among many Michigan trout streams. We found a high degree of synchrony in average May discharge among streams, particularly those in the northern portion of Michigans Lower Peninsula. There were significant correlations in the long-term densities of brown trout and brook trout year-classes among several rivers in this area, including sites up to 140 km apart and rivers draining into different Great Lakes. Predicted numbers of days to 50\% swim-up of brown trout fry were similar among four streams and synchronous, further supporting the hypothesis of synchrony in trout population dynamics in Michigan streams at the regional scale. Long-term trout population estimates and streamflow data collected from a network of long-term index (fixed) sites throughout Michigan will aid in further description of the spatial extent of synchrony in trout populations.}
