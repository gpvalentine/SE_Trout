Climate change affects effects animal and plant populations over broad geographic ranges due to spatially autocorrelated abiotic conditions. However, populations do not always respond to broad-scale environmental changes synchronously across a landscape. In this paper, we used a retrospective analysis of time-series count data (5-28 annual samples per site) at 170 sites dispersed over nearly 1,000 km to characterize structure and scale of spatial population synchrony in a coldwater stream fish (brook trout *Salvelinus fontinalis*) which is sensitive to temperature and flow alterations, in its southern native range. Spatial synchrony differed by life stage and geographic region: it was stronger in the early life stage of trout than a later stage and in northern sub-populations than southern sub-populations. Spatial synchrony of trout populations extended to 100-150 km but was much weaker than that of climate variables such as temperature, stream flow, and precipitation. Abundance of only the early life stage changed over time due to annual variation in summer temperature and winter and spring stream flow conditions. Climate effects on abundance differed between subregions and among stream segments, indicating multiple cross-scale interactions and that climate interacted with local habitat to generate only a modest pattern of population synchrony over space. Population synchrony was not spatially autocorrelated at the regional or sub-regional scales. We conclude that local populations of brook trout show heterogeneous responses to climate variation due to cross-scale interactions and are not equally susceptible to climate change. This response diversity indicates that some local sites characterized by population asynchrony and resistance to climate variation would most likely sustain populations of this iconic native coldwater fish in a changing climate. Identifying such high priority sites and incorporating them in the landscape-level conservation planning is imperative to their conservation, and our approach is applicable to other widespread species sensitive to climate change.
