# Abstract {-}

Spatial synchrony is a key element of macrosystem ecology that can influence extinction probability. As climatic changes alter thermal and flow regimes, brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) will face major challenges, particularly in their southern native range. Understanding patterns in synchrony and the influence of climate factors on spatiotemporal dynamics in brook trout populations will be critical for broad-scale conservation planning. Using spatial covariance techniques and a Bayesian population model, we measure the scales and drivers of spatial synchrony by size class and regional populations using electrofishing data at over 100 long-term sites in the eastern US. Synchrony was low, but stronger in young-of-year than adults. Northern populations experienced stronger synchrony than southern populations, and synchrony in all populations extended to 100-150km. Summer high temperatures were the strongest driver of population trends, followed by winter floods. Here, we characterize the linkages between abiotic conditions and trout population trends, as well as identify potential climate refugia. Our analysis offers unique insight into spatial patterns in threatened brook trout populations.
