Climate change affects animal and plant populations over broad geographic ranges due to spatially autocorrelated abiotic conditions ("Moran Effect"). However, populations do not always respond to broad-scale environmental changes synchronously across a landscape. We used a retrospective analysis of time-series count data (5-28 annual samples per site) at 170 stream segments dispersed over nearly 1,000 km to characterize structure and scale of spatial population synchrony in a coldwater stream fish (brook trout *Salvelinus fontinalis*) which is sensitive to temperature and flow alterations, in its southern native range. Spatial synchrony differed by life stage and geographic region: it was stronger in the early life stage than a later stage and in the northern sub-region than the southern sub-region. Spatial synchrony of trout populations extended to 100-150 km but was much weaker than that of climate variables such as temperature, stream flow, and precipitation. Abundance of only the early life stage changed over time due to annual variation in summer temperature and winter and spring stream flow conditions. Climate effects on abundance differed between subregions and among local populations, indicating multiple cross-scale interactions where climate interacted with local habitat to generate only a modest pattern of population synchrony over space. Population synchrony was not spatially autocorrelated at the regional or sub-regional scales. We conclude that heterogeneous responses to climate variation lead to only a modest level of spatial synchrony among local trout populations, which are not equally susceptible to climate change. This response heterogeneity indicates that some local segments characterized by population asynchrony and resistance to climate variation could represent unique populations of this iconic native coldwater fish that warrant attention in their conservation planning in a changing climate. Identifying such priority populations and incorporating them in the landscape-level conservation planning is imperative to their conservation, and our approach is applicable to other widespread species sensitive to climate change.
