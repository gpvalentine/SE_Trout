This R project/directory was initiated on Oct. 27, 2022 by George Valentine from existing project files (contact George for access)

- Analysis files in the initial commit are as they were in the former project on that date.
	- "Bayesian Spatial Synchrony Analysis V13.R" was copied in as "SE_Trout_nMix.R"
	- "Synchrony Analysis w_Correlograms v3.R" was copied in as "SE_Trout_Correlograms.R"
	- "Variogram analysis of Bayesian N-mixture model parameters.R" was copied in as "SE_Trout_nMix_Result_Variograms.R"
- Writing files in the initial commit were brought in from v1, which was written in MS Word.
- Data files in the initial commit were copied in from the prior data organization, and are as they were on 10//27/22. In the future, data files can be brought/linked in from a data repository.
	- "SE_COMID_flow_covars.csv" was copied in as "SE_Trout_COMID_flow_covars.csv"
	- "SE_COMID_temp_covars.csv" was copied in as "SE_Trout_COMID_temp_covars.csv"
- Results files are created, version by version, by the analysis files, and saved in the "Results" folder. The writing files draw from those results.
